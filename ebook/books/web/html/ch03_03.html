<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3">3.3 HTML Tags</A></h2>

<p class=para>
For the most part, HTML document tags are simple
to understand and use, since they are made up of common words, abbreviations,
and notations. For instance, the <tt>&lt;i&gt;</TT> and <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</TT>
tags tell the browser to respectively start and stop italicizing
the text characters that come between them. Accordingly, the syllable
"simp" in our barebones HTML example would appear
italicized on a browser display.

<p class=para>
The HTML standard
and its various extensions define how and where you place tags within
a document. Let's take a closer look at that syntactic
sugar that holds together all HTML documents.

<p class=para>
tag
syntax

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.1">The Syntax of a Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Every
HTML tag consists of a tag <i class=emphasis>name</I>, sometimes
followed by an optional list of tag <i class=emphasis>attributes</I>,
all placed between opening and closing brackets (<tt>&lt; and&gt;</TT>). The simplest tag is nothing more than a name appropriately
enclosed in brackets, such as <tt>&lt;head&gt;</TT> and <tt>&lt;i&gt;</TT>.
More complicated tags contain one or more attributes, which specify
or modify the behavior of the tag.

<p class=para>
Tag and attribute names are not case-sensitive.
There's no difference in effect between <tt>&lt;head&gt;</TT>,
<tt>&lt;Head&gt;</TT>, <tt>&lt;HEAD&gt;</TT>, or even <tt>&lt;HeaD&gt;</TT>;
they are all equivalent. The values that you assign to a particular
attribute may be case-sensitive, however, depending on your browser
and server. In particular, file location and name references--universal
resource locators (URLs)--are case-sensitive. [<a href="ch07_02.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-2">the section called "Referencing Documents: The URL"</A>]

<p class=para>
Tag attributes, if any, belong after the tag name, each separated
by one or more tab, space, or return characters. Their order of
appearance is not important.

<p class=para>
A tag attribute's
value, if any, follows an 
equal sign (=)
after the attribute name. You may include spaces around the equal
sign, so that width=6, width = 6, width =6,
and width= 6 all mean the same. For readability, however,
we prefer not to include spaces. That way, it's easier
to pick out an attribute/value pair from a crowd of pairs
in a lengthy tag.

<p class=para>
If an attribute's
value is a single word or number (no spaces), you may simply add
it after the equal sign. All other values should be enclosed in
single or double quotation marks, especially those values that contain
several words separated by spaces. The length of the value is limited
to 1024 characters.

<p class=para>
Most browsers are tolerant of how
tags are punctuated and broken across lines. Nonetheless, avoid
breaking tags across lines in your source document whenever possible.
This rule promotes readability and reduces potential errors in your
HTML documents.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.2">Sample Tags</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Here are some tags with attributes:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog.html"&gt;
&lt;ul compact&gt;
&lt;input name=filename size=24 maxlength=80&gt;
&lt;link title="Table of Contents"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The
first example is the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag for a hyperlink to
O'Reilly &amp; Associates' World Wide Web-based
catalog of products. It has a single attribute, href, followed by
the catalog's address in cyberspace--its URL.

<p class=para>
The second example shows a tag that formats text into an unordered
list of items. Its single attribute--compact, which limits
the space between list items--does not require a value.

<p class=para>
The third example shows a tag with multiple attributes,
each with a value that does not require enclosing quotation marks.

<p class=para>
The last example shows proper use of enclosing quotation
marks when the attribute value is more than one word long.

<p class=para>
Finally, what is not immediately evident in these examples
is that while attribute names are not case-sensitive (href works
the same as HREF and HreF), most attribute values are case-sensitive.
The value filename for the name attribute in the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
tag example is not the same as the value Filename, for instance.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.3">Starting and Ending Tags</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We alluded earlier to the
fact that most HTML tags have a beginning and an end and affect
the portion of text between them. That enclosed text segment may
be large or small, from a single text character, syllable, or word,
such as the italicized "simp" syllable in our
barebones example, to the <tt>&lt;html&gt;</TT> tag that bounds
the entire document. The starting component of any tag is the tag
name and its attributes, if any. The corresponding ending tag is
the tag name alone, preceded by a slash. Ending tags have no attributes.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.4">Proper and Improper Nesting</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Tags can be put inside the
affected segment of another tag (nested) for multiple tag effects
on a single segment of the HTML document. For example, a portion
of the following text is both bold and included as part of an anchor
defined by the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
This is some text in the body, with a
&lt;a href="another_doc.html"&gt;link, a portion of which
is &lt;b&gt;set in bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
According to the HTML standard, you must end nested tags starting
with the most recent one and work your way back out. For instance
in the example, we end the bold tag (<tt>&lt;/b&gt;</TT>)
before ending the link tag (<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</TT>) since
we started in the reverse order: <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag first,
then <tt>&lt;b&gt;</TT> tag. It's a good idea to follow
that standard, even though most browsers don't absolutely
insist you do so. You may get away with violating this nesting rule
for one browser, sometimes even with all current browsers. But eventually
a new browser version won't allow the violation and you'll
be hard pressed to straighten out your source HTML document.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.5">Tags Without Ends</A></h3>

<p class=para>
According to the HTML
standard, only a few tags do not have an ending tag. For example,
the <tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tag causes a line break; it has no effect
otherwise on the subsequent portion of the document and, hence,
does not need an ending tag.

<p class=para>
The standard HTML tags
that do not have corresponding ending tags are:

<div class=simplelist>

<p>
<tt>&lt;area&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;base&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;basefont&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;hr&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;isindex&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;link&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;nextid&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;option&gt;</TT><br>
<tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT><br>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.6">Omitting Tags</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You often see documents in which
the author seemingly has forgotten to include many ending tags in
apparent violation of the HTML standard. But your browser doesn't
complain, and the documents displays just fine. What gives? The
HTML standard lets you omit certain tags or their endings for clarity
and ease of preparation. The HTML standard writers didn't
intend the language to be tedious.

<p class=para>
For example, the
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag that defines the start of a paragraph
has a corresponding end tag <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT>, but
the <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> ending tag rarely is used. In
fact, many HTML authors don't even know it exists! [<a href="ch04_01.html#HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2">the section called "The <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

<p class=para>
Rather, the HTML standard lets you omit a starting
tag or ending tag whenever it can be unambiguously inferred by the
surrounding context. Many browsers make good guesses when confronted
with missing tags, leading the document author to assume that a
valid omission was made. When in doubt, add the ending tag: it'll
make life easier for yourself, the browser, and anyone else who
might need to modify your document in the future.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-3-SECT-3.7">Ignored or Redundant Tags</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Browsers
sometimes ignore tags. This usually happens with redundant tags
whose effects merely cancel or substitute for themselves. The best
example is a series of 
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>
tags, one after the other with no intervening text. Unlike the similar
series of repeating return characters in a text-processing document,
most browsers skip to a new line only once. The extra <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>
tags are redundant and usually ignored by the browser.

<p class=para>
character
entities

<p class=para>
In addition, most browsers ignore any tag that
they don't understand or that was incorrectly specified
by the document author. Browsers habitually forge ahead and make
some sense of a document, no matter how badly formed and error-ridden
it may be. This isn't just a tactic to overcome errors,
it's also an important strategy for extensibility. Imagine
how much harder it would be to add new features to the language
if the existing base of browsers choked on them.

<p class=para>
The
thing to watch out for with nonstandard tags that aren't
supported by most browsers is their enclosed contents, if any. Browsers
that recognize the new tag may process those contents differently
than those that don't support the new tag. For example,
Internet Explorer supports a 
<tt>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> tag whose contents
serve to document the source HTML and are not intended to be viewed
by the user. However, none of the other browsers recognizes the
<tt>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> tag and render its contents on the user's
screen, effectively defeating the tag's purpose in addition
to ruining 
the document's
appearance. [<a href="ch03_04.html#HTML-CH-3-SECT-4.2">the section called "Character Entities"</A>]
