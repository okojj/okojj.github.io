<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-2">1.2 Talking the Internet Talk</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Every
computer connected to the Internet (even a beat-up old Apple II)
has a unique address: a number whose format is defined by the <i class=emphasis>Internet
Protocol (IP)</I>, the standard that defines how messages
are passed from one machine to another on the Net. An <i class=emphasis>IP
address</I> is made up of four numbers, each less than 255,
joined together by periods, such as 192.12.248.73 or 131.58.97.254.

<p class=para>
While
computers deal only with numbers, people prefer names. For this
reason, each computer on the Internet also has a name bestowed upon
it by its owner. There are several million machines on the Net,
so it would be very difficult to come up with that many unique names,
let alone keep track of them all. Recall, though, that the Internet
is a network of networks. It is divided into groups known as <i class=emphasis>domains</I>,
which are further divided into one or more <i class=emphasis>subdomains.</I>
So, while you might choose a very common name for your computer,
it becomes unique when you append, like surnames, all of the machine's
domain names as a period-separated suffix, creating a <i class=emphasis>fully
qualified </I>domain name.

<p class=para>
This naming stuff is easier than it sounds.
For example, the fully qualified domain name <i class=emphasis>www.ora.com</I>
translates to a machine named "www" that's
part of the domain known as "ora," which, in turn,
is part of the commercial (com) branch of the Internet. Other branches
of the Internet include educational (edu) institutions, nonprofit
organizations (org), U.S. government (gov), and Internet service
providers (net). Computers and networks outside the United States
have a two-letter abbreviation at the end of their names: for example,
"ca" for Canada, "jp" for Japan,
and "uk" for the United Kingdom.

<p class=para>
Special computers, known as <i class=emphasis>name servers</I>,
keep tables of machine names and their associated unique IP numerical
addresses, and translate one into the other for us and for our machines.
Domain names must be registered with the nonprofit organization
InterNIC. Once registered, the owner of the domain name broadcasts
it and its address to other domain name servers around the world.
Each domain and subdomain has an associated name server, so ultimately
every machine is known uniquely by both a name and an IP address.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-2.1">Clients, Servers, and Browsers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
Internet connects two kinds of computers: <i class=emphasis>servers</I>,
which serve up documents, and <i class=emphasis>clients</I>, which
retrieve and display documents for us humans. Things that happen
on the server machine are said to be on the <i class=emphasis>server side</I>,
while activities on the client machine occur on the <i class=emphasis>client
side</I>.

<p class=para>
To
access and display HTML documents, we run programs called <i class=emphasis>browsers</I>
on our client computers. These browser clients talk to special <i class=emphasis>web
servers</I> over the Internet to access and retrieve electronic
documents.

<p class=para>
Several Web browsers are available--most
are free--each offering a different set of features. For
example, browsers like Lynx run on character-based clients and display
documents only as text. Others run on clients with graphical displays
and render documents using proportional fonts and color graphics
on a 1024 x 768, 24-bit-per-pixel display.
Others still--Netscape Navigator, Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, NCSA Mosaic, Netcom's WebCruiser, and InterCon's
NetShark, to name a few--have special features that allow
you to retrieve and display a variety of electronic documents over
the Internet, including audio and video multimedia.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-2.2">The Flow of Information</A></h3>

<p class=para>
All
web activity begins on the client side, when a user starts their
browser. The browser begins by loading a <i class=emphasis>home page</I>
HTML document from either local storage or from a server over some
network, such as the Internet. In the latter case, the client browser
first consults a domain name server to translate the home page document
server's name, such as <i class=emphasis>www.ora.com</I>,
into an IP address, before sending a request to that server over
the Internet. This request (and the server's reply) is
formatted according to the dictates of the 
<i class=emphasis>HyperText Transfer Protocol</I>(HTTP) standard.

<p class=para>
A
server spends most of its time listening to the Internet, waiting
for document requests with the server's unique address
stamped on it. Upon receipt, the server verifies that the requesting
browser is allowed to retrieve documents from the server and, if
so, checks for the requested document. If found, the server sends
(downloads) the document to the browser. The server usually logs
the request, the client computer's name, document requested,
and the time.

<p class=para>
Back on the browser, the document arrives.
If it's a plain-vanilla ASCII text file, most browsers
display it in a common, plain-vanilla way. Document directories,
too, are treated like plain documents, although most graphical browsers
will display folder icons, which the user can select with the mouse
to download the contents of subdirectories.

<p class=para>
Browsers also retrieve binary files from a server.
Unless assisted by a <i class=emphasis>helper</I> program or specially
enabled by <i class=emphasis>plug-in</I> software or <i class=emphasis>applets</I>,
which display an image or video file or play an audio file, the
browser usually stores downloaded binary files directly on a local
disk for later attention by the user.

<p class=para>
For the most part,
however, the browser retrieves a special document that appears to
be a plain text file, but contains both text and special markup
codes called <i class=emphasis>tags</I>. The browser processes these
HTML documents, formatting the text based upon the tags and downloading
special accessory files, such as images.

<p class=para>
The user reads
the document, selects a hyperlink to another document, and the entire
process starts over.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-2.3">Beneath the World Wide Web</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We should
point out at this juncture that browsers and HTTP servers need not
be part of the Internet's World Wide Web to function. In
fact, you never need to be connected to the Internet, or to any
network for that matter, to write HTML documents and operate a browser.
You can load up and display on your client browser locally stored
HTML documents and accessory files directly. This isolation is good:
it gives you the opportunity to finish, in the editorial sense of
the word, a document collection for later distribution. Diligent
HTML authors work locally to write and proof their documents before
releasing them for general distribution, thereby sparing readers
the agonies of broken image files and bogus hyperlinks.[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
Vigorous
testing of the HTML documents once they are made available on the
Web is, of course, also highly recommended and necessary to rid
them of various linking bugs.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Organizations, too, can be connected
to the Internet and the World Wide Web, but also maintain private
webs and HTML document collections for distribution to clients on
their local network, or <i class=emphasis>intranet</I>. In fact,
private webs are fast becoming the technology of choice for the
paperless offices we've heard so much about these last
few years. With HTML document collections, businesses and other
enterprises can maintain personnel databases, complete with employee
photographs and online handbooks, collections of blueprints, parts,
and assembly manuals, and so on--all readily and easily
accessed electronically by authorized users and displayed on a local
computer.
