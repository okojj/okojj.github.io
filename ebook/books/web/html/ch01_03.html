<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-3">1.3 HTML: What It Is</A></h2>

<p class=para>
HTML
is a document-layout and hyperlink-specification language. It defines
the syntax and placement of special, embedded directions that aren't
displayed by the browser, but tell it how to display the contents
of the document, including text, images, and other support media.
The language also tells you how to make a document interactive through
special hypertext links, which connect your document with other
documents--on either your computer or someone else's,
as well as with other Internet resources, like FTP and Gopher.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-3.1">HTML Standards and Extensions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
basic syntax and semantics of HTML are defined in the HTML standard,
currently Version 3.2. HTML is a young language, barely five years
old, but already in its third iteration. Don't be too surprised
if another version appears before you finish reading this book.
Given the pace of these standards matters, one never knows when
or if a new standard version will come to fruition.

<p class=para>
Browser developers rely upon the HTML standard to
program the software that formats and displays common HTML documents.
Authors use the standard to make sure they are writing effective,
correct HTML documents. Nonetheless, commercial forces have pushed
developers to add into their browsers--Netscape Navigator
and Internet Explorer, in particular--nonstandard extensions
meant to improve the language. Many times, these extensions are
implementations of future standards still under debate. Extensions
can foretell future standards because so many people use them.

<p class=para>
In this book, we explore in detail the syntax, semantics,
and idioms of HTML 3.2, along with the many important extensions
that are supported in the latest versions of the most popular browsers,
so that any aspiring HTML author can create fabulous documents with
a minimum of effort.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-3.2">Standards Organizations</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Like many popular technologies, HTML started out
as an informal specification used by only a few people. As more
and more authors began to use the language, it became obvious that
more formal means were needed to define and manage--to standardize--HTML's
features, making it easier for everyone to create and share documents.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-3.2.1">The World Wide Web Consortium</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed with the charter to define
the standard versions of HTML. Members are responsible for drafting,
circulating for review, and modifying the standard based on cross-Internet
feedback to best meet the needs of the many.

<p class=para>
Beyond
HTML, the W3C has the broader responsibility of standardizing any
technology related to the World Wide Web; they manage the HTTP standard,
as well as related standards for document addressing on the Web.
And they solicit draft standards for extensions to existing Web
technologies, such as internationalization of the HTML standard.

<p class=para>
If you want to track HTML development and related technologies,
contact the W3C at <i class=emphasis><a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a></I>. Several
Internet newsgroups are devoted to the Web, each a part of the
<i class=emphasis>comp.infosystems.www</I>
hierarchy. These include <i class=emphasis>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html</I>
and <i class=emphasis>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images</I>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-3.2.2">The Internet Engineering Task Force</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Even broader in reach than W3C, the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) is responsible for defining and managing every
aspect of Internet technology. The World Wide Web is just one small
part under the purview of the IETF.

<p class=para>
The IETF defines
all of the technology of the Internet via official documents known
as Requests For Comment, or RFCs. Individually numbered for easy
reference, each RFC addresses a specific Internet technology--everything
from the syntax of domain names and the allocation of IP addresses
to the format of electronic mail messages.

<p class=para>
To learn
more about the IETF and follow the progress of various RFCs as they
are circulated for review and revision, visit the IETF home page,
