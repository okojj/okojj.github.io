<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-5">1.5 Nonstandard Extensions</A></h2>

<p class=para>
You don't have to write
in HTML 3.2 for long before you realize its limitations. That's
why Netscape Navigator quickly became the most popular browser less
than a year after it was released. While others were content to
implement HTML standards, the developers at Netscape were hard at
work extending the language and their browser to capture the potentially
lucrative and certainly exciting commercial markets on the Web.

<p class=para>
With a market presence like that, Netscape leads not only
the market, but the standards drive as well. Those browser features
that Netscape provides and that aren't part of HTML 3.2
quickly become de facto standards because so many people use them.
Consequently, Netscape is the browser other developers must emulate.
For instance, Internet Explorer, developed in collaboration with
Spyglass (the purveyor of NCSA technologies) and bundled with Windows
95, adopts most of Netscape's enhancements to HTML and
has some embellishments of its own.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-5.1">Extensions: Pro and Con</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Every software
vendor adheres to the technological standards; it's embarrassing
to be incompatible and your competitors will take every opportunity
to remind buyers of your product's failure to comply, no
matter how arcane or useless that standard might be. At the same
time, vendors seek to make their products different and better than
the competition's offerings. Netscape's and Internet
Explorer's extensions to standard HTML are perfect examples
of these market pressures at work.

<p class=para>
Many HTML document
authors feel safe using these extended browsers' nonstandard
extensions, because of their combined and commanding share of users.
For better or worse, extensions to HTML made by the folks at Netscape
or Microsoft instantly become part of the street version of HTML,
much like English slang creeping into the vocabulary of most Frenchmen
despite the best efforts of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise.

<p class=para>
The reality, however, is that browsers are becoming less and
less standard--de facto or not. The W3C isn't keeping
up. And other browser developers are not about to remain quiescent
for long. Increasingly, browser competitors are implementing the
many extensions to HTML and adding a few of their own for good measure.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-5.2">Avoiding Extensions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In general, we urge
you to resist using an HTML extension unless you have a compelling
and overriding reason to do so. By using them, particularly in key
portions of your documents, you run the risk of losing a substantial
portion of your potential readership. Sure, the Netscape community
is large enough to make this point moot now, but even so, you are
excluding several million people without Netscape from your pages.

<p class=para>
Of course, there are varying degrees of dependency on HTML
extensions. If you use some of the horizontal rule extensions, for
example, most other browsers will ignore the extended attributes
and render a conventional horizontal rule. On the other hand, reliance
upon a number of font size changes and text alignment extensions
to control your document appearance will make your document look
terrible on many alternative browsers. It might not even display
at all on browsers that don't support the extensions.

<p class=para>
We admit that it is a bit disingenuous of us to decry the
use of HTML extensions while presenting complete descriptions of
their use. In keeping with the general philosophy of the Internet,
we'll err on the side of handing out rope and guns to all
interested parties while hoping you have enough smarts to keep from
hanging yourself or shooting yourself in the foot.

<p class=para>
Our
advice still holds, though: only use an extension where it is necessary
or very advantageous, and do so with the understanding that you
are disenfranchising a portion of your audience. To that end, you
might even consider providing separate, standards-based versions
of your documents to accommodate users of other browsers.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-1-SECT-5.3">Beyond Extensions: Exploiting Bugs</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It is one thing
to take advantage of an extension to HTML, and quite another to
exploit known bugs in a particular version of a browser to achieve
some unusual document effect.

<p class=para>
A
good example is the multiple-body bug in Version 1.1 of Netscape
Navigator. The HTML standard insists that an HTML document have
exactly one <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag, containing the body of
the document. The now-obsolete browser allowed any number of <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tags, processing and rendering each <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> in
turn. By placing several <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tags in an HTML
document, an author could achieve crude animation effects when the
document was first loaded into the browser. The most popular trick
used several <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tags, each with a slightly
different background color. This trick results in a document fade-in
effect.

<p class=para>
The party ended when Version 1.2 of Netscape
fixed the bug. Suddenly, thousands of documents lost their fancy
fade-in effect. Although faced with some rather fierce complaints,
to their credit, the people at Netscape stood by their decision
to adhere to the standard, placing compliance higher on their list
of priorities than nifty rendering hacks.

<p class=para>
In that light,
we can unequivocally offer this advice: <i class=emphasis>never</I>
exploit a bug in a browser to achieve a particular effect in your
documents.
