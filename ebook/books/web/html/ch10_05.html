<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5">10.5 Creating Effective Forms</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Properly
done, a form can provide an effective user interface for your readers.
With some server-side programming tricks, you can use forms to personalize
the HTML documents you present to readers, and thereby significantly
increase the value of your pages on the Web.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.1">Browser Constraints</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As with other HTML elements, browsers have
varying abilities to display and manage forms.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.1.1">Browser limitations</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Unlike other graphical-user
interfaces, browser displays are static. They have little or no
capability for real-time data validation, for example, or to update
the values in a form based upon user input, giving users help and
guidance.[5]
Hence, poorly designed web forms can be difficult to fill out.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[5] 
This is not entirely true. While HTML does
not provide for data validation and user guidance, it is possible
to attach Java or JavaScript applets to your form elements that
do a very nice job of validating form data, updating form fields
based upon user input, and guiding users through your forms.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Make sure your forms assist the user as much as possible in
getting their input correct. Adjust the size of text input fields
to give clues on acceptable input; five- (or the new nine-) character-wide
zipcode fields, for instance. Use checkboxes, radio buttons, and
selection lists whenever possible to narrow the list of choices
the user must make.

<p class=para>
Make sure you also adequately document
your forms. Explain how to fill them out, supplying examples for
each field. Provide appropriate hyperlinks to documentation that
describes each field, if necessary.

<p class=para>
When the form is
submitted, make sure the server-side application exhaustively validates
the user's data. If an error is discovered, present the
user with intelligent error messages and possible corrections. One
of the most frustrating aspects of filling out forms is having to
start over from scratch whenever the server discovers an error.
To alleviate this ugly redundancy and burden on your readers, consider
spending extra time and resources on the server side that returns
the user's completed form with the erroneous fields flagged
for changes.

<p class=para>
While all of these suggestions require
significant effort on your part, they will pay off many times over
by making life easier for your users. Remember, you'll
write the HTML for the form just once, but it may be used thousands
or even millions of times by users.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.1.2">Handling limited displays</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The most common
client on the Web is a PC running Windows on a 640x480
pixel display. The actual document-viewing window typically is around
600x400 4pixels;
roughly 75 readable characters wide and 30 to 50 lines tall. You
should design your forms (and all your documents) so they are effective
when viewed through a window of this size.

<p class=para>
You should
structure your form to naturally scroll into two or three logical
sections. The user can fill out the first section, page down; fill
out the second section, page down; and so forth.

<p class=para>
You
should also avoid wide input elements. It is difficult enough to
deal with a scrolling-text field or text area without having to
scroll the document itself horizontally to see additional portions
of the input element.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.2">User Interface Considerations</A></h3>

<p class=para>
When
you elect to create a form, you immediately assume another role:
that of a user-interface designer. While a complete discussion of
user interface design is beyond the scope of this book, it helps
to understand a few basic design rules to create effective, attractive
forms.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.2.1">Basic user-interface design</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Any user
interface is perceived at several levels simultaneously. Forms are
no different. At the lowest level, your brain recognizes shapes
within the document, attempting to categorize the elements of the
form. At a higher level, you are reading the text guides and prompts,
trying to determine what input is required of you. At the highest
level, you are seeking to accomplish a goal with the interface as
your tool.

<p class=para>
A good form accommodates all three of these
perceptive needs. Input elements should be organized in logical
groups so that your brain can process the form layout in chunks
of related fields. Consistent, well-written prompts and supporting
text assist and lead the user to enter the correct information.
Text prompts also remind users of the task at hand and reinforce
the form's goal.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.2.2">Creating forms that flow</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Users process
forms in a predictable order, one element after another, seeking
to find the next element as they finish the previous one. To accommodate
this searching process, you should design your forms so that one
field leads naturally to another, and related fields are grouped
together. Similarly, groups should lead naturally to one another
and should be formatted in a consistent manner.

<p class=para>
Simply
stringing a number of fields together does not constitute an effective
form. You must put yourself in the place of your users, who are
using the form for the first time. Test your form on unsuspecting
friends and colleagues before you release it on the general public.
Is it easy to determine the purpose of the form? Where do you start
filling things out? Can the user find a button to push to submit
the form? Is there an opportunity to confirm decisions? Do readers
understand what is expected of them for each field?

<p class=para>
Your
forms should lead the user naturally through the process of supplying
the necessary data for the application. You wouldn't ask
for a street address before asking for the user's name;
other rules may dictate the ordering of other groups of input elements.
To see if your form really works, make sure you view it on several
browsers and have several people fill it out and comment on its
effectiveness.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-5.3">Good Form, Old Chap</A></h3>

<p class=para>
At
first glance, the basic rule of HTML--content, not style--seems
in direct opposition to the basic rule of good interface design--precise,
consistent layout. Even so, it is possible to use some HTML elements
to greatly improve the layout and readability of most forms.

<p class=para>
Traditional page layout uses a grid of columns to align common
elements within a page. The resulting implied vertical and horizontal
"edges" of adjacent elements give a sense of order
and organization to the page, and makes it easy for the eye to scan
and follow.

<p class=para>
HTML makes it hard, but you can accomplish
the same sort of layout for your forms. For example, you can group
related elements and separate groups with empty paragraphs or horizontal
rules.

<p class=para>
Vertical alignment is more difficult but not
impossible. In general, forms are easier to use if you arrange the
input elements vertically and aligned to a common margin. One popular
form layout keeps the left edge of the input elements aligned, with
the element labels immediately to the left of the elements. This
is done by using tables to place and align each form element and
its label. Here is our previous form example, with the labels placed
in the first column and the corresponding elements in the second:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;form method=POST action="http://www.kumquat.com/demo"&gt;
  &lt;table border=0&gt;
    &lt;tr valign=top&gt;
      &lt;td align=right&gt;Name:&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=left&gt;&lt;input type=text name=name size=32 maxlength=80&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr valign=top &gt;
      &lt;td align=right&gt;Sex:&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=left&gt;
        &lt;input type=radio name=sex value="M"&gt; Male &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;input type=radio name=sex value="F"&gt; Female
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr valign=top &gt;
      &lt;td align=right&gt;Income:&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=left&gt;
        &lt;select name=income size=1&gt;
          &lt;option&gt;Under $25,000
          &lt;option&gt;$25,001 to $50,000
          &lt;option&gt;$50,001 and higher
        &lt;/select&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr valign=top&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=2 align=center&gt;
        &lt;input type=submit value="Submit Query"&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice in the resulting rendered form shown in <a href="#HTML-CH-10-FIG-6">Figure 10.6</A>
that the table has placed each input element in its own row. The
align attributes in the table cells force the labels to the right
and the elements to the left, creating a vertical margin through
the form. By spanning the cell in the last row, the submission button
is centered with respect to the entire form. In general, using tables
in this manner makes form layout much easier and consistent throughout
your documents.

<div class=figure>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
You may find other consistent ways to lay
out your forms. The key is to find a useful layout style that works
well across most browsers and stick with it. Even though HTML has
limited tools to control layout and positioning, take advantage
of what is available to make your forms more attractive and easier
to use.
