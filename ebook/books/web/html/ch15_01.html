We've sprinkled a number of tips, tricks, and hacks throughout this
book, along with style guidelines, examples, and instructions. So why
have a special chapter on tips, tricks, and hacks of HTML? Because
it's where many readers will leaf when they pick up this book for the
first time. HTML is the language, albeit constrained, that makes the
World Wide Web on the Internet the exciting place that it is. And
interested readers want to know, "How do I do the cool stuff?"

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-15-SECT-1">15.1 Top of the Tips</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The most important tip for even veteran HTML authors is to surf for
yourself.  We can show and explain a few neat tricks to get you
started, but there are thousands of HTML authors out there combining
and recombining HTML tags and juggling content to create compelling
and useful documents.

<p class=para>
Get a bona fide Internet account; get a copy of Netscape, Internet
Explorer, and whatever other browser you feel comfortable operating;
get connected; and get cruising. Collect web site URLs from friends,
business associates, and the traditional media. Even local TV and
radio stations have taken to announcing some of their sponsors' web
site URLs. And consult the many different Internet web directories
like Yahoo and AltaVista for new and up-to-date addresses for the web
sites that suit your lifestyle or business niche.

<p class=para>
Examine (don't steal) their pages for eye-catching and effective pages
and use them to guide your own creations. Capture and examine the
source HTML documents for the juicy bits. Get a feel of the more
effective web collections. How are their documents organized? How
large is each document? And so on.

<p class=para>
We all learn from experience, so go get it.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-15-SECT-1.1">Design for Your Audience</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We continuously argue throughout the book that, with HTML documents,
content matters most, not look. That doesn't mean that presentation
doesn't matter.

<p class=para>
Effective HTML documents match your target audience's expectations,
giving them a familiar environment in which to explore and gather
information. Serious academicians expect a treatise on the physiology
of the kumquat to appear journal-like: long on meaningful words,
figures, and diagrams and short on frivolous trappings like cute
bullets and font abuse. Don't insult the reader's eye, except when
exercising artistic license to jar or attack your reader's
sensibilities.

<p class=para>
By anticipating your audience and by designing your documents to
appeal to their tastes, you also subtly deflect unwanted surfers from
your pages. Undesirables, such as penniless college students surfing
your commercial site, may hog your server's resources and prevent the
buying audience you desire from ready access to your pages.

<p class=para>
For example, you can use subtle colors and muted text transitions
between sections for a classical art museum's collection to mimic the
hushed environment of a real classical art museum. The typical
rock-n-roll crazed web surfer maniac probably won't spend more than a
glance at your site, but the millionaire arts patron might.

<p class=para>
Also, use effective layout to gently guide your readers' eyes to areas
of interest in your documents. Do that by adhering to the basic rules
of document layout and design, such as placing figures and diagrams
nearby--if not inline--with their content
reference. Nothing's worse than having to scroll up and down the
browser window in a desperate search for a picture that can explain
everything.

<p class=para>
We won't lie and suggest that we're design experts. We aren't, but
they're not hard to find. So, another tip for the serious web page
author: seek professional help. The best situation is to have design
experience yourself. Next best is to have a pro looking over your
shoulder, or at least somewhere within earshot.

<p class=para>
Make a trip to your local library and do some reading on your own,
too.  Even better yet, browse the various online HTML guides. Check
out <i class=citetitle>Designing for the Web</i> by O'Reilly &amp;
Associates.  Your readers will be glad you did. [<a href="ch01_06.html#HTML-CH-1-SECT-6">the section called "Tools for the HTML Designer"</A>]

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-15-SECT-1.2">Boilerplate HTML Documents</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The next best tip we can give you is to reuse your documents. Don't
start from scratch each time. Rather, develop a consistent framework,
even to the point of a content outline into which you add the detail
and character for each page. You might even endevour to create style
sheets, so that the look and feel of you documents remain consistent.

<p class=para>
Here's our contribution to help start your boilerplate HTML document
collection. The following source contains what the HTML standard
currently tells us is the minimum content that should appear in every
HTML document (regardless of what the browsers might let you get away
with) and then some added for document clarity.  Use it as a skeleton
for your own HTML documents:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Required--replace this title with your own&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reiterate the title here&lt;/h3&gt;
...Insert your document's contents here...
&lt;address&gt;Include your name and contact information
usually at the end of the document&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>
