<p class=para>
The standard HTML document model is a static one. Once displayed on
the browser, a document does not change unless the user initiates some
activity like selecting a hyperlink with the mouse. The developers at
Netscape Communications found that limitation unacceptable and built
in some special features to their Navigator browser that let you
change HTML document content dynamically. In fact, they provide for
two different mechanisms for dynamic documents, which we describe in
detail in this chapter. Internet Explorer supports some of these
mechanisms, which we'll discuss as well.

<p class=para>
We should mention that many people believe dynamic documents will be
obsolete in a very short time, displaced by plug-in browser
accessories and, in particular, applets. Nonetheless, Netscape and
Internet Explorer continue to support dynamic documents, and we
believe the technology has virtues you should be aware of, if not take
advantage of, in your HTML documents.  [<a href="ch13_01.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-1">the section called "Applets"</A>]

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-14-SECT-1">14.1 An Overview of Dynamic Documents</A></h2>

<p class=para>
If you remember from our discussion in <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, <i>HTML and the World Wide Web</i></A>, the
client browser initiates data flow on the Web by contacting a server
with a document request.  The server honors the request by downloading
the document. The client subsequently displays the document's contents
to the user.  For normal web documents, a single transaction initiated
from the client side is all that is needed to collect and display the
document.  Once displayed, however, it does not change.

<p class=para>
Dynamic documents, on the other hand, are the result of multiple
transactions initiated from either or both the server side and the
client side.  A <i class=emphasis>client-pull</I> document is one that
initiates multiple transactions from the client side. When the server
is the instigator, the dynamic document is known as a <i class=emphasis>server-push</I> document.

<p class=para>
In a client-pull document, special HTML codes tell the client to
periodically request and download another document from one or more
servers on the network, dynamically updating the display.

<p class=para>
Server-push documents also advance the way servers communicate with
clients.  Normally over the Web, the client stays connected with a
server for only as long as it takes to retrieve a single
document.[1]
With server-push documents, the connection remains open and the
server continues to send data periodically to the client, adding
to or replacing the previous contents.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
One connection per document is true even for inline images
browsers may automatically download from the server. If you don't
believe us, just watch the status line at the bottom of your browser
while you download an HTML document with several images. You should
see many "Contacting the server" and "Reading
the file..." or similar messages.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Netscape is currently the only browser able to handle server-push
dynamic HTML documents correctly; both Internet Explorer and Netscape
support client-pull documents. With other browsers, you might see only
part of the dynamic document at best. At worst, the browser will
completely reject the document. Unfortunately, because dynamic
documents are client-server processes, they don't work without an HTTP
server. That means you can't develop and test your dynamic HTML
documents stored as local files, unless you have a server running
locally, as well.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-14-SECT-1.1">Another Word of Caution</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As always, we tell you exactly how to use these exciting but
nonstandard features, and we admonish you not to use them unless you
have a compelling and overriding reason to do so. We are particularly
strident with that admonition for dynamic documents, not only because
they aren't part of the HTML standard, but because dynamic documents
can hog the network. They require larger, longer downloads than their
static counterparts. And they require many more (in the case of
client-pull) or longer-term (for server-push) client-server
connections. Multiple connections on a single server are limited to a
few of the vast millions of Web users at a time. We'd hate to see your
readers miss out because you've created a jiggling image in a dynamic
HTML document that would otherwise have been an effective and readily
accessible static document more people could enjoy.
