Until this point, we've dealt with HTML documents as standalone
entities, concentrating on the language elements you use for structure
and to format your work. The true power of HTML, however, lies in its
ability to join collections of documents together into a full library
of information, and to link documents with other collections around
the world. Just as readers have considerable control over how the
document looks onscreen, with hyperlinks they also have control over
the order of presentation as they navigate through your information.
It's the "HT" in HTML--hypertext--and it's the twist that
spins the Web.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-1">7.1 Hypertext Basics</A></h2>

<p class=para>
A fundamental feature of hypertext is that you can hyperlink
documents; you can point to another place inside the current document,
inside another document in the local collection, or inside a document
anywhere on the Internet. The documents thereby become an intricately
woven web of information. Get the name analogy now? The target
document is usually somehow related to and enriches the source; the
linking element in the source should convey that relationship to the
reader.

<p class=para>
Hyperlinks can be used for all kinds of effects. They can
be used inside tables of contents and lists of topics. With a click
of the mouse on their browser screen, readers select and automatically
jump to a topic of interest in the same document or to another document
located in an entirely different collection somewhere around the
world.

<p class=para>
Hyperlinks also point readers to more information
about a mentioned topic. "For more information, see `Kumquats
on Parade,'" for example. HTML authors use hyperlinks
to reduce repetitive information. For instance, we recommend you
sign your name to each of your documents. Rather than include full
contact information in each document, a hyperlink connects your
name to a single place that contains your address, phone number,
and so forth.

<p class=para>
A hyperlink, or <i class=emphasis>anchor</I> in HTML
standard parlance, is marked by the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag and
comes in two flavors. As we detail below, one type of anchor creates
a hot spot in the document that, when activated and selected (usually
with a mouse) by the user, causes the browser to link. It automatically
loads and displays another portion of the same or another document
altogether, or triggers some Internet service-related action, such
as sending email or downloading a special file. The other type of
anchor creates a label, a place in an HTML document that can be
referenced as a hyperlink.[1]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Both types of HTML anchors
use the same tag; perhaps that's why they have the same
name. Nonetheless, we find it's easier if you differentiate
them and think of the one type that provides the hotspot and address
of a hyperlink as the "link," and the other type
that marks the target portion of a document as the "anchor."
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
There also are some mouse-related events associated with hyperlinks
that, through the new JavaScript technologies, let you perform some
new and exciting effects.
