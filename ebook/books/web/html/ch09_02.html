<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2">9.2 Style Syntax</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The syntax of a style, as you
may have gleaned from our previous examples, is fairly straightforward.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.1">The Basics</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A style rule is made up of
at least three basic parts: a tag<i class=emphasis> selector</I>,
which identifies the name of the tag that the style rule affects,
followed by a curly brace ({}) enclosed, semicolon-separated
list of one or more style property:value declaration pairs:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
tag-selector {property1:value1; property2:value1 value2 value3; ...}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Properties require
at least one value, but may include two or more values. Separate
multiple values with a space, as is done for the three values that
define property2 in the example. Some properties require that multiple
values be separated with commas.

<p class=para>
Style-conscious browsers
ignore letter case in any element of a rule. Hence, H1 and h1 are
the same selector, and COLOR, color, ColOR, and cOLor are equivalent
properties. Convention dictates, however, that tag names be in all
capitals, and that you write properties and values in lowercase.
We'll abide by those conventions throughout this book.

<p class=para>
Any valid HTML tag name (a tag minus its enclosing "&lt;"
and "&gt;" characters and attributes) can
be a selector. You may include more than one tag name in the list
of selectors, as we explain in the following sections.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.2">Multiple Selectors</A></h3>

<p class=para>
When
separated by commas, all the tags named in the selector list get
affected by the property values in the style rule. This can make
life very easy for the HTML author. For instance:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 {text-align: center}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
does exactly the same thing as:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
H1 {text-align: center}
H2 {text-align: center}
H3 {text-align: center}
H4 {text-align: center}
H5 {text-align: center}
H6 {text-align: center}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Both styles tell the browser
to center the contents of the header tag levels 1-6. Clearly,
the first version is easier to type, understand, and modify. And
it takes less time and fewer resources to transmit across a network,
as well.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.3">Contextual Selectors</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Normally, the style-conscious
browser applies styles to the tags wherever they appear in your
document, without regard to context. However, the CSS standard does
define a way to have a style applied only when a tag occurs within
a certain context within a document, such as when it is nested within
other tags.

<p class=para>
To create a contextual selector, list the
tags in the order in which they should be nested in your document,
outermost tag first. When that 
nesting
order is encountered by the browser, the style properties will be
applied to the last tag in the list.

<p class=para>
For example, here's
how you might use contextual styles to define the classic numbering
sequence used for outlines: capital letters for the outer level,
upper-case Roman numerals for the next level, lowercase letters
for the next, and Arabic numerals for the innermost level:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
OL LI {list-style: upper-alpha}
OL OL LI {list-style: upper-roman}
OL OL OL LI {list-style: lower-alpha}
OL OL OL OL LI {list-style: decimal}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
According to the example style sheet, when the style-conscious
browser encounters the <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag nested within
one <tt>&lt;ol&gt;</TT> tag, it uses the upper-alpha value for
the list-style property of the <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag. When
it sees an <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag nested within two <tt>&lt;ol&gt;</TT>
tags, the same browser will use the upper-roman list-style. Nest
an <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag within three and four <tt>&lt;ol&gt;</TT>
tags, and you'll see the lower-alpha and decimal list-style
used, respectively.

<p class=para>
Similarly, you may impose a specific
style on tags related only by context. For instance, this contextual
style definition will color the emphasis tag's (<tt>&lt;em&gt;</TT>)
contents red only when it appears inside a level-one header tag
(<tt>&lt;h1&gt;</TT>), not elsewhere in the document:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
H1 EM {color: red}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If there is a potential ambiguity between two contextual styles,
the more specific context prevails. Like individual tags, you may
also have several contextual selectors mixed with individual selectors,
each and all separated by commas, sharing the same list of style
declarations. For example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
H1 EM, P STRONG, ADDRESS {color: red}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
means that you'll see red whenever the <tt>&lt;em&gt;</TT>
tag appears within an <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</TT> tag, or when the <tt>&lt;strong&gt;</TT>
tag appears within a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag, and for the contents
of the <tt>&lt;address&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
The nesting
need not be exact to match the rule. For example, if you nest the
<tt>&lt;strong&gt;</TT> tag within a <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</TT> tag
within a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag, you'll still match
the rule for P STRONG that we defined above. If a particular nesting
matches several style rules, the most specific rule is used. For
example, if you defined two contextual selectors:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
P STRONG {color: red}
P UL STRONG {color: blue}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
and
use the sequence <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT><tt>&lt;ul&gt;</TT><tt>&lt;strong&gt;</TT>
in your document, the second, more specific rule applies, coloring
the contents of the <tt>&lt;strong&gt;</TT> tag blue.

<p class=para>
Contextual
selectors are supported by Netscape 4.0, but not by Internet Explorer
3.0. In fact, Internet Explorer 3.0 considers contextual selectors
an error and ignores any subsequent style definitions.

<p class=para>
class attribute

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4">Style Classes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
There is one more feature of
style sheets that we haven't mentioned yet: classes. Classes
let you create, at the document level or in an external style sheet,
several different styles for a single tag, each distinguished by
a class name. To apply the style class, you name it as the value
of the class attribute in the tag.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4.1">Regular classes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
In a technical paper
you might want to define one paragraph style for the abstract, another
for equations, and a third for centered quotations. None of the
paragraph tags may have an explicit context in the HTML document
so you could distinguish it from the others. Rather, you may define
each as a different style class:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;style&gt;
&lt;!--
P.abstract {font-style: italic; 
            left-margin: 0.5cm; 
            right-margin: 0.5cm}
P.equation {font-family: Symbol; 
            text-align: center}
H1, P.centered {text-align: center; 
                left-margin: 0.5cm; 
                right-margin: 0.5cm}
--&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice first in the example that defining a class is simply
a matter of appending a period-separated class name as a suffix
to the tag name as the selector in a style rule. The class name
can be any sequence of letters, numbers, and hyphens, but must begin
with a letter.[1] And
classes, like all selectors, may be included with other selectors,
separated by commas, as in the third example. The only restriction
on classes is that they cannot be nested: P.equation.centered is
not allowed, for example.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Due to its support of JavaScript style
sheets, Netscape cannot handle class names that happen to match
JavaScript keywords. The class "abstract," for
instance, generates an error in Netscape.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Accordingly, the first rule
in the example creates a class of paragraph styles named "abstract"
whose text will be italic and indented from the left and right margins
by a half-centimeter. Similarly, the second paragraph style class
"equation," instructs the browser to center the
text and to use the Symbol typeface to display the text. The last
style rule creates a style with centered text and half-centimeter
margins, applying this style to all level-one headers as well as
creating a class of the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag named centered
with that style.

<p class=para>
To use a particular class of a tag,
you add the class attribute to the tag, as in this example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;p class=abstract&gt;
This is the abstract paragraph.  See how the margins are indented?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The equation paragraph follows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=equation&gt;
a = b + 1
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=centered&gt;
This paragraph's text should be centered.
&lt;/p&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
For each paragraph, the value of the class attribute is the
name of the class to be used for that tag.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4.2">Generic classes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You may also define a class without associating
it with a particular tag, and then apply that class selectively
through your documents for a variety of tags. For example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
.italic {font-style: italic}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
creates a generic class named italic. To use it, simply include
its name with the class attribute. So, for instance, use <tt>&lt;p
class=italic&gt;</TT> or <tt>&lt;pre class=italic&gt;</TT>
to create an italic paragraph or preformatted text block.

<p class=para>
Generic
classes are quite handy and make it easy to apply a particular style
to a broad range of tags. Generic classes are currently supported
only by Netscape 4.0.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4.3">Style pseudo-classes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
In addition to conventional style classes, the
CSS standard defines pseudo-classes, although no browser yet uses
them. They are the way you define the display style for certain
tag states. Pseudo-classes are like regular classes, with two notable
differences: they are attached to the tag name with a colon instead
of a period, and they have predefined names, not arbitrary ones
you may give them.

<p class=para>
There are five pseudo-classes, three
of which are associated with the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag. The
other two go with the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
The
browsers distinguish three special states for the hyperlinks created
by the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag: not visited, being visited, and
visited. The browser may change the appearance of the tag's
contents to indicate its state, such as underlining or changing
the colors. Through pseudo-classes, the HTML author can control
how these states get displayed by defining styles for A:link, A:active,
and A:visited. The link pseudo-class controls the appearance of
links that are not selected by the user and have not yet been visited.
The active pseudo-class defines the appearance of links that are
currently selected by the user and are being processed by the browser.
The visited pseudo-class defines those links that have already been
visited by the user.

<p class=para>
To completely define all three
states of the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag, you might write

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
A:link {color: blue}
A:active {color: red; font-weight: bold}
A:visited {color: green}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Unvisited
links will be shown in blue. When the user clicks a link, the browser
will change its text color to red and make it bold. Once visited,
the link will revert to conventional green text.

<p class=para>
The
two other pseudo-classes go with the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag,
and are named first-letter and first-line. As you might expect,
these pseudo-classes control the appearance of the first letter
and first line, respectively, of a paragraph and create effects
commonly found in printed media, such as initial drop-caps and bold
first lines. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
P:first-line {font-style: small-caps}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
converts the first line of a paragraph to small capital letters.
Similarly,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
P:first-letter {font-size: 200%; float: left}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
tells the browser to
make the first letter of a paragraph twice as large as the remaining
text and float the letter to the left, allowing the first two lines
of the paragraph to float around the larger initial letter.[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
The properties that can be specified for the first-letter
and first-line pseudo-classes are the font properties, color and
background properties, text-decoration, vertical-align, text-transform,
line-height, and clear. In addition, the first-letter pseudo-class
accepts the margin properties, padding properties, border properties,
and float. The first-line pseudo-class also accepts the word-spacing
and letter-spacing properties.
</blockquote>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4.4">Mixing classes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You may mix pseudo-classes
with regular classes by appending the pseudo-class name to the selector's
class name. For example, here are some rules that define plain,
normal, and fancy anchors:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
A.plain:link, A.plain:active, A.plain:visited {color: blue}
A:link {color: blue}
A:visited {color: green}
A:active {color: red}
A.fancy:link {text-style: italic}
A.fancy:visited {text-style: normal}
A.fancy:active {text-weight: bold; font-size: 150%}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The plain version of <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> is always blue,
no matter the state of the link. Normal links start out blue, turn
red when active, and convert to green when visited. The fancy link
inherits the color scheme of the normal <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag,
but adds italic text for unvisited links, converts back to normal
text after being visited, and actually grows 50 percent in size
and becomes bold when active.

<p class=para>
A word of warning about
that last property of the fancy class: specifying a font size change
for a transient display property will result in lots of browser
redisplay activity when the user clicks on the link. Given that
some browsers run on slow machines, this redisplay may be annoying
to your readers. Given also that implementing that sort of display
change is something of a pain, it is unlikely that most browsers
will support radical appearance changes in <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT>
tag pseudo-classes.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4.5">Class inheritance</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Classes inherit the style properties of their
generic base tag. For instance, all the properties of the plain
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag apply to a specially defined paragraph
class, except where the class overrides a particular property.

<p class=para>
Classes cannot inherit from other classes, only from the unclassed
version of the tag they represent. In general, therefore, you should
put as many common styles into the rule for the basic version of
a tag, and only create classes for those properties which are unique
to that class. This makes maintenance and sharing of your style
classes easier, especially for large document collections.
