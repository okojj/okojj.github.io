<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2">5.2 Inserting Images in Your Documents</A></h2>

<p class=para>
One of the most compelling features of
HTML is its ability to include images with your document text, either
as an intrinsic component of the document (inline images), as separate
documents specially selected for download via hyperlinks, or as
a background for your document. When judiciously added to the body
content, images--static and animated icons, pictures, illustrations,
drawings, and so on--can make your documents more attractive,
inviting, and professional looking, as well as informative and easier
to browse. You may also specially enable an image so that it becomes
a visual map of hyperlinks. When used to excess, however, images
make your document cluttered, confusing, and inaccessible, as well
as unnecessarily lengthening the time it takes for users to download
and view your pages.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1">Understanding Image Formats</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The HTML standard does not prescribe an official
format for images. However, the popular browsers specifically accommodate
only certain image formats: GIF and JPEG, in particular (see following
sections for explanations). Most other multimedia formats require
special accessory applications that each browser owner must obtain,
install, and successfully operate to view the special files. So
it's not too surprising that GIF and JPEG are the de facto
image standards on the Web.

<p class=para>
Both image formats were
already in widespread use before the Web came into being, so there's
lots of supporting software out there to help you prepare your graphics
for either format. However, each has its own advantages and drawbacks,
including features that some browsers exploit for special display
effects.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1.1">GIF</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
was first developed for image transfer among users of the CompuServe
online service. The format has several features that make it popular
for use in HTML documents. Its encoding is cross-platform, so that
with appropriate GIF decoding software (included with most browsers),
the graphics you create and make into a GIF file on a Macintosh,
for example, can be loaded into a Windows-based PC, decoded, and
viewed without a lot of fuss. The second main feature is that GIF
uses special compression technology that can significantly reduce
the size of the image file for faster transfer over a network. GIF
compression is "lossless," too; none of an image's
original data is altered or deleted, so the uncompressed and decoded
image exactly matches its original. And GIF images can be easily
animated.

<p class=para>
Even though GIF image files invariably have the
<i class=filename>.gif</i> (or <i class=filename>.GIF</i>)
filename suffix, there actually are two GIF versions: the original
GIF87 and an expanded GIF89a, which supports several new features,
including transparent backgrounds, interlaced storage, and animation,
that are popular with HTML authors (see 
<a href="#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1.2">the section called "Interlacing, transparency, and animation"</A>). The currently popular browsers
support both GIF versions, which use the same encoding scheme that
maps 8-bit pixel values to a color table, for a maximum of 256 colors
per image. Most GIF images have even fewer colors and there are
special tools to simplify the colors in more elaborate graphics.  By
simplifying the GIF images, you create a smaller color map and enhance
pixel redundancy for better file compression and consequent faster
downloading.

<p class=para>
However, because of the limited number of colors, a GIF-encoded image
is not always appropriate, particularly for photorealistic pictures
(see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1.3">the section called "JPEG"</A>). Rather, GIFs make excellent icons, reduced
color images, and drawings.

<p class=para>
Because most graphical browsers
explicitly support the GIF format, it is currently the most widely
accepted image-encoding format on the Web. It is acceptable for
both inline images and externally linked ones. When in doubt as
to which image format to use, choose GIF.[2]
It will work in almost any situation.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
We cannot
resist the temptation to point out that choosy authors choose GIF.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1.2">Interlacing, transparency, and animation</A></h4>

<p class=para>
GIF
images can be made to perform three special tricks: 
interlacing,
transparency, and animation. With interlacing, a GIF image seemingly
materializes on the display, rather than progressively flowing onto
it from top to bottom. Normally, a GIF encoded image is a sequence
of pixel data, in order row-by-row, from top to bottom of the image.
While the common GIF image renders onscreen like pulling down a
window shade, interlaced GIFs open like a venetian blind. That's
because interlacing sequences every fourth row of the image. Users
get to see a full image--top to bottom, albeit fuzzy--in
a quarter of the time it takes to download and display the remainder
of the image. The resulting quarter-done image usually is clear
enough so that users with slow network connections can evaluate
whether to take the time to download the remainder of the image
file.

<p class=para>
Not all graphical browsers, although able to
display an interlaced GIF, are actually able to display the materializing
effects of interlacing. With those that do, users still can defeat
the effect by choosing to delay image display until after download
and decoding. Older browsers, on the other hand, always download
and decode images before display, and don't support the
effect at all.

<p class=para>
Another popular effect available with
GIF images--GIF89a-formatted images, actually--is
the ability to make a portion of them 
transparent so that what's
underneath--usually the browser window's background--shows
through. The transparent GIF image has one color in its color map
designated as the background color. The browser simply ignores any
pixel in the image that uses that background color, thereby letting
the display window's background show through. By carefully
cropping its dimensions and by using a solid, contiguous background
color, a transparent image can be made to seamlessly meld into a
page's surrounding content or float above it.

<p class=para>
Transparent
GIF images are great for any graphic you want to meld into the document
and not stand out as a rectangular block. Transparent GIF logos
are very popular, as are transparent icons and dingbats--any
graphic that should appear to have an arbitrary, natural shape.
You may also insert a transparent image inline with conventional
text to act as a special character glyph within conventional text.

<p class=para>
The downside to transparency is that the GIF image
will look lousy if you don't remove its border when included
in a hyperlink anchor (<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag ), or
is otherwise specially framed. And content flow happens around the
image's rectangular dimensions, not adjacent to its apparent
shape. That can lead to unnecessarily isolated images or odd-looking
sections in your HTML pages.

<p class=para>
The third unique trick
available to the HTML author with GIF89a-formatted images is the
ability to do simple frame-by-frame 
animation.
Using special GIF animation software utilities, you may prepare
a single GIF89a file to contain a series of GIF images. The browser
displays each image in the file, one after the other, something
like the page-flipping animation booklets we had (even drew!) as
kids. Special control segments between each image in the GIF file
let you set the number of times the browser runs through the complete
sequence (looping), how long to pause between each image, whether
or not the image space gets wiped to background before the browser
displays the next image, and so on. By combining these control features
with those normally available for GIF images, including individual
color tables, transparency, and interlacing, you can create some
very appealing and elaborate animations.[3]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
Songline Studios has published an entire book dedicated to GIF
animation: <i class=citetitle>GIF Animation Studio</i>, by Richard Koman
(1996).
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Although simple, GIF animation is powerful for one other important
reason: You don't need to specially program your HTML documents
to achieve animation. But there is one major downside that limits
their use except for small, icon-sized, or thin bands of space in
the browser window: GIF animation files get large fast, even if
you are careful not to repeat static portions of the image in successive
animation cells. And if you have several animations in one document,
download delays may--and usually will--annoy the
user. If there is any feature on your HTML that deserves close scrutiny
for excess, it's GIF animation.

<p class=para>
Any and all
GIF tricks--interlacing, transparency, and animation--don't
just happen; you need special software to prepare the GIF file.
Many image tools now save your creations or acquired images in GIF
format, and most now let you enable transparency, as well as let
you make interlaced GIF files. There also are a slew of shareware
and freeware programs specialized for these tasks, as well as for
creating GIF animation. Look into your favorite Internet software
archives for GIF graphics and conversion tools and also see 
<a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, <i>Tips, Tricks, and Hacks</i></A>, for details on creating transparent
images.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.1.3">JPEG</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
Joint
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is a standards body that developed
what is now known as the JPEG image-encoding format. Like GIFs,
JPEG images are platform-independent and specially compressed for
high-speed transfer via digital communication technologies. Unlike
GIF, JPEG supports tens of thousands of colors for more detailed,
photorealistic digital images. And JPEG uses special algorithms
that yield much higher data-compression ratios. It is not uncommon,
for example, for a 200-kilobyte GIF image to be reduced to a 30-kilobyte
JPEG image. To achieve that amazing compression, JPEG does lose
some image data. However, you can adjust the degree of "lossiness"
with special JPEG tools, so that although the uncompressed image
may not exactly match the original, it will be close enough that
most people cannot tell the difference.

<p class=para>
Although JPEG
is an excellent choice for photographs, it's not a particularly
good choice for illustrations. The algorithms used for compressing
and uncompressing the image leave noticeable artifacts when dealing
with large areas of one color. Therefore, if you're trying
to display a drawing, the GIF format may be preferable.

<p class=para>
The JPEG format, usually designated by the <i class=filename>.jpg</i>
(or <i class=filename>.JPG</i>) filename suffix, is nearly universally
understood by today's graphical browsers. On rare occasions, you'll
come across an older browser that cannot directly display JPEG images.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.2">When to Use Images</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Most pictures are worth a thousand words. But don't forget that no one
pays attention to a blabbermouth. First and foremost, think of your
HTML document images as visual tools, not gratuitous trappings. They
should support your text content and help readers navigate your
documents. Use images to clarify, illustrate, or exemplify the
contents.  Content supporting photographs, charts, graphs, maps, and
drawings are all natural candidates for appropriate HTML
images. Product photographs are essential components in online
catalogs and shopping guides, for example. And link-enabled icons and
dingbats, including animated images, can be effective visual guides to
internal and external resources. If an image doesn't do any of these
valuable services for your document, throw it out already!

<p class=para>
One of the most important considerations when adding images to a
document is the additional delay they add to the retrieval time for a
document over the network, particularly for modem connections. While a
simple text document might run, at most, 10 or 15 thousand bytes,
images can easily extend to hundreds of thousands of bytes each. And
the total retrieval time for a document is not only equal to the sum
of all its component parts, but also to compounded networking overhead
delays since each image requires a separate connection and download
request between the client browser and the web server. Depending on
the speed of the connection (<i class=emphasis>bandwidth</I>, usually
expressed as bits or bytes per second) as well as network congestion
that can delay connections, a single document containing one
100-kilobyte image may take anywhere from around 30 seconds through a
28.8 kilobit-per-second modem connection in the wee hours of the
morning when most everyone else is asleep, to well over <i class=emphasis>ten
minutes</I> with a 9600 bit-per-second modem at noontime. You
get the picture?

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.3">When to Use Text</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Text hasn't gone
out of style. For some users, it is the only portion of your document
they can access. We argue that, in most circumstances, your documents
should be usable by readers who cannot view images or have disabled
their automatic download in their browser to improve their low-speed
connection. While the urge to add images to all of your documents
may be strong, there are times when pure text documents make more
sense.

<p class=para>
Documents being converted to the Web from other
formats rarely have embedded images. Reference materials and other
serious content often is completely usable in a text-only form.

<p class=para>
You should create text-only documents when access speed is
critical and potentially slow. If you know that many users will
have only low-speed connections to your pages, you should accommodate
them by avoiding the use of images within your documents. Better
yet, provide a home (leading) page that lets readers decide between
duplicate collections of your work: one containing the images, and
another stripped of them. (The popular browsers include special
picture icons as place holders for yet-to-be downloaded images,
which can trash and muddle your document's layout into
an unreadable mess.)

<p class=para>
Text is most appropriate--supporting
images only, without frills or nonessential graphics--if
your documents are to be readily searchable by any of the many Web
indexing services. Images are almost always ignored by these search
engines. If the major content of your pages is provided with images,
very little information about your documents will find its way into
the online web directories.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.4">Speeding Image Downloads</A></h3>

<p class=para>
There are several
ways to ameliorate the overhead and delays inherent with images,
besides being very choosy about which to include in your documents.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>Keep it simple.<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A full-screen, 24-bit color graphic, even when reduced
in size by digital compression with one of the standard formats
like GIF or JPEG, is still going to be a network bandwidth hog.
Acquire and use the various image management tools to optimize image
dimensions and number of colors into the fewest number of pixels.
Simplify your drawings. Stay away from panoramic photographs. Avoid
large empty backgrounds in your images, as well as gratuitous borders
and other space-consuming elements. Also avoid dithering (blending
two colors among adjacent pixels to achieve a third color); the
technique can significantly reduce the compressibility of your images.
Strive for large areas of uniform colors, which compress readily
in both GIF and JPEG format.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Reuse images.<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
This is particularly true for icons and GIF animations.
Most browsers cache incoming document components in local storage
for the very purpose of quick, network connection-less
retrieval of data. For smaller GIF animation files, try to prepare
each successive image to only update portions that change in the
animation, rather than redraw the entire image (this speeds up the
animation, too).

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Divide up large documents.<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
This is a general rule that includes images. Many
small document segments, organized through hyperlinks (of course!)
and effective tables of contents tend to be better accepted by users
than a few large documents. In general, people would rather "flip"
several pages than dawdle waiting for a large one to download. (It's
related to the TV channel-surfing syndrome.) One accepted rule of
thumb is to keep your documents under 50 kilobytes each, so even
the slowest connections won't overly frustrate your readers.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Isolate necessarily large graphics.<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
Provide a special link to large images, perhaps
one that includes a thumbnail of the graphic, thereby letting readers
decide if and when they want to spend the time downloading the full
image. And since the downloaded image isn't mixed with
other document components like inline images, it's much
easier for the reader to identify and save the image on their system's
local storage for later study. (For details on non-inline image
downloads, see <a href="ch04_07.html#HTML-CH-4-SECT-7">the section called "Precise Spacing and Layout"</A>.)

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Specify image dimensions.<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
Finally, another way to improve performance is by
including the image's rectangular height and width information
in its tag. By supplying those dimensions, you eliminate the extra
steps the extended browsers must take to download, examine, and
calculate an image's space in the document. There is a
downside to this approach, however, that we explore in 5.2.6.11.</DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.5">JPEG or GIF?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You may choose to use only 
JPEG
or 
GIF images in your HTML
documents if your sources for images or your software toolset prefers
one over the other format. Both are nearly universally supported
by today's browsers, so there shouldn't be any
user-viewing problems.

<p class=para>
Nevertheless, we recommend that
you acquire the facilities to create and convert to both formats,
to take advantage of their unique capabilities. For instance, use
GIF's transparency feature for icons and dingbats. Alternatively,
use JPEG for large and colorful images for faster downloading.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6">The <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag lets
you reference and insert a graphic image into the current text flow
of your HTML document. There is no implied line or paragraph break
before or after the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag, so images can be
truly "inline" with text and other content.

<p class=para>
The format of the image itself is not defined
by the HTML standard, although the popular graphical browsers support
GIF and JPEG images. The HTML standard doesn't specify
or restrict the size or dimensions of the image, either. Images
may have any number of colors, but how those colors are rendered
is highly browser-dependent.

<p class=para>
Image presentation in general is very browser-specific.
Images may be ignored by nongraphical browsers. Browsers operating
in a constrained environment may modify the image size or complexity.
And users, particularly those with slow network connections, may
choose to defer image loading altogether. Accordingly, you should
make sure your documents make sense and are useful, even if the
images are completely removed.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.1">The src attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
src attribute for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT>
tag is required (unless you use dynsrc with Internet Explorer-based
movies; see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.1">the section called "The dynsrc attribute"</A>). Its value is the image file's URL,
either absolute or relative to the HTML document referencing the
image. To unclutter their document storage, HTML authors typically
collect image files into a separate folder they often name something
like "pics" or "images." [<a href="ch07_02.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-2">the section called "Referencing Documents: The URL"</A>]

<p class=para>
For example, this HTML fragment places an image of a famous kumquat
packing plant into the narrative text (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-8">Figure 5.8</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Here we are, on day 17 of the tour, in front of the kumquat
packing plant:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="pics/packing_plant.gif"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What an exciting moment, to see the boxes of fruit moving
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the example, the paragraph (<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>) tags
surrounding the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag cause the browser to
render the image by itself with some vertical space after the preceding
text and before the trailing text. Text may also abut the image,
as we describe in <a href="#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.4">the section called "The align attribute"</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-8">Figure 5.8: Image integrated with text</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0508.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-8]" width=500 height=278 border=0>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.2">The lowsrc attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
To
the benefit of users, particularly those with slow Internet connections,
Netscape provides the lowsrc companion to the src attribute in the
<tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag as a way to speed up document rendering.
The lowsrc attribute's value, like src, is the URL of an
image file that the browser loads and displays when it first encounters
the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag. Then, when the document has been
completely loaded and can be read by the user, Netscape goes back
and retrieves the image specified by the src attribute.

<p class=para>
Ostensibly,
the lowsrc image is a low-resolution, abbreviated version of the
final src image that loads faster by comparison to quickly give
the reader an idea of its content until the final, higher-resolution
image eventually replaces it onscreen. But the lowsrc attribute
can also be used for some very special effects.

<p class=para>
Netscape
uses the lowsrc image's dimensions to reserve space in
the document for both the lowsrc and src images, unless you explicitly
allocate that space with the height and width attributes described
later in this chapter. Hence, if the dimensions of the image specified
in the src attribute are different than those for the lowsrc image
or your explicitly included height and width values, the src image
will be reduced, enlarged, stretched, and/or compressed
to fit in the allotted space. Moreover, the lowsrc and src images
needn't be identical, so you might take advantage of the
delayed rendering of the src image for simple animation.

<p class=para>
The
lowsrc attribute is for Netscape only. Other browsers ignore it
and only load the image specified by the src attribute. Netscape
won't load either image if the user chooses not to auto-load
images. In that case, both images will load in order when the user
clicks the images button or clicks the image icon placeholder. No
browser loads the lowsrc image only; you must include a src image,
otherwise nothing will appear except the missing image icon.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.3">The alt attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
alt attribute
specifies alternative text the browser may show if image display
is not possible or disabled by the user. It's an option,
but one we highly recommend you exercise for most images in your
document. This way, if the image is not available, the user still
has some indication of what it is that's missing.

<p class=para>
The value for the alt attribute is a text string of up to
1024 characters, enclosed in quotation marks if you include spaces
or other punctuation. The alternative text may contain entity references
to special characters, but it may not contain any other sort of
markup; in particular, no style tags are allowed.

<p class=para>
Graphical
browsers ignore the alt attribute if the image is available and
downloading is enabled by the user. Otherwise, they insert the alt
attribute's text as a label next to an image placeholder
icon. Well-chosen alt labels thereby additionally support those
users with a graphical browser who have disabled their automatic
image download because of a slow connection to the Web.

<p class=para>
Nongraphical,
text-only browsers like Lynx put the alt text directly into the
content flow just like any other text element. So, when used effectively,
the alt tag sometimes can transparently substitute for missing images.
(Your text-only browser users will appreciate not being constantly
reminded of their second-class Web citizenship.) For example, consider
using an asterisk as the alt attribute alternative to a special
bullet icon:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src="pics/fancy_bullet.gif" alt="*"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A graphical browser displays the bullet image, while in a
nongraphical browser the alt asterisk takes the place of the missing
bullet. Similarly, use alt text to replace special image bullets
for list items. For example, the following code:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Kumquat recipes &lt;img src="pics/new.gif" alt="(New!)"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Annual harvest dates
&lt;/ul&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
displays the new.gif image with graphical browsers, and the
text "(New!)" with text-only browsers.

<p class=para>
image
alignment

<p class=para>
The alt attribute lets you use even more complex
text (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-9">Figure 5.9</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Here we are, on day 17 of the tour, in front of the kumquat

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.4">The align attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The
HTML standard does not define a default alignment for images with
respect to other text and images in the same line of text, so you
cannot absolutely predict how the mixture of text and images will
look.[4] HTML images normally
appear in line with a single line of text. Our common media like
magazines typically wrap text around images, with several lines
next to and abutting the image, not just a single line.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
Most of the popular graphical browsers normally
insert an image so that its base aligns with the baseline of the
text--the same alignment as that specified by the attribute
value of bottom. Nonetheless, HTML document designers should assume
that alignment varies between browsers and always include the desired
type of image alignment.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Fortunately,
HTML document designers can exert some control over the alignment
of images with the surrounding text through the align attribute
for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag. The HTML standard specifies
five image-alignment attribute values: left, right, top, middle,
and bottom. The left and right values flow any subsequent text around
the image, which is moved to the corresponding margin; the remaining
three align the image vertically with respect to the surrounding
text. Netscape adds four more vertical alignment attributes to that
list: texttop, absmiddle, baseline, and absbottom, while Internet
Explorer adds center.

<p class=para>
The following list contains descriptions
for the inline HTML image alignments; see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-10">Figure 5.10</A>
for examples.

</DIV>

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>top<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The
top of the image is aligned with the top edge of the tallest item
in the current line of text. If there are no other images in the
current line, the top of the image is aligned with the top of the
text.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>texttop (Netscape)<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The align=texttop attribute and value tells
Netscape to align the top of the image with the top of the tallest
text item in the current line. This is slightly different from the
standard HTML top option, which aligns the top of the image with
the top of the tallest item, image or text, in the current line.
If the line contains no other images that extend above the top of
the text, texttop and top have the same effect.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>middle<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
Netscape and Internet Explorer treat the middle
image alignment value differently: Netscape always aligns the middle
of the image to the baseline of the text, regardless of other inline
elements, such as another inline image (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-11">Figure 5.11</A>).
Internet Explorer, on the other hand, aligns the middle of the image
to the middle of the tallest item in the current line, text or image
(see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-12">Figure 5.12</A>).
Notice the alignments and differences in <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-11">Figure 5.11</A>
and <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-12">Figure 5.12</A>, particularly when only one image contains the align
attribute. Both figures display the HTML fragment:</DL>
<div class=screen>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Also note that Internet Explorer Version 3 treats middle,
absmiddle, and center the same, whereas earlier Internet Explorer
versions and the current Netscape (Version 4) distinguishes between
middle and absmiddle alignments. (If you are confused as to exactly
what each alignment value means, please raise your hand.)

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>absmiddle<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If you set the align attribute of the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT>
tag to absmiddle, the browser will fit the absolute middle of the
image to the absolute middle of the current line. For Netscape and
earlier versions of Internet Explorer, this is different from the
common middle option, which aligns the middle of the image with
the baseline of the current line of text (the bottom of the characters).
Version 3 of Internet Explorer, on the other hand, treats absmiddle
the same as middle and center.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>center<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The center image alignment value gets treated the
same as absmiddle by both Internet Explorer and Netscape, but note
that the browsers treat absmiddle and middle differently.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>bottom and baseline (default)<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
With Netscape and earlier versions of Internet Explorer,
the bottom and baseline image alignment values have the same effect
as if you didn't include any alignment attribute at all:
the browsers align the bottom of the image in the same horizontal
plane as the baseline of the text. This is not to be confused with
the absbottom, which takes into account letter "descenders"
like the tail on the lowercase "y." Internet Explorer
Version 3, on the other hand, treats bottom the same as absbottom.
(Did we see a hand up in the audience?)

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>absbottom<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The align=absbottom
attribute tells the browsers to align the bottom of the image with
the true bottom of the current line of text. The true bottom is
the lowest point in the text taking into account descenders, even
if there are no descenders in the line. A descender is the tail
on a "y," for example; the baseline of the text
is the bottom of the "v" in the "y"
character.</DL>
<p class=para>
Use
the top or middle alignment values for best integration of icons,
dingbats, or other special inline effects with the text content.
Otherwise, align=bottom (the default) usually gives the
best appearance. When aligning one or more images on a single line,
select the alignment that gives the best overall appearance to your
document.

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.5">Wrapping text around images</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The left

against the left or right margin, respectively, of the current text
flow. The browser then renders subsequent document content in the
remaining portion of the flow adjacent to the image. The net result
is that the document content following the image gets wrapped around
the image.

</DIV>

<p class=para>
While text is flowing around an image, the
left (or right) margin of the page is temporarily redefined to be
adjacent to the image as opposed to the edge of the page. This means
that subsequent images with the same alignment will stack up against
each other. The following source fragment achieves that staggered
image effect:

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.6">Centering an image</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Have you noticed
that you can't horizontally center an image in the browser
window with the align attribute? The middle and absmiddle values
center the image vertically with the current line, but the image
is horizontally justified depending on what content comes before
it in the current flow and the dimensions of the browser window.

<p class=para>
You can horizontally center an inline image in the browser
window, but only if it's isolated from surrounding content,
such as by paragraph, division, or line break tags. Then, either
use the <tt>&lt;center&gt;</TT> tag, or use the align=center
attribute or center-justified style in the paragraph or division
tag to center the image. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>

&lt;img src="pics/kumquat.gif"&gt;

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.7">The border attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Browsers
normally render images that also are hyperlinks (included in an
<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag) with a two-pixel-wide colored border,
indicating to the reader that the image can be selected to visit
the associated document. You can change the thickness of that border
with the border attribute to the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag. The
value of the border attribute is an integer equal to the border
thickness in pixels.

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.8">Removing the image border</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You can eliminate the border around an image hyperlink altogether with
the border=0 attribute within the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag. For some
images, particularly image maps, the absence of a border can greatly
improve the appearance of your pages. Images that are clearly link
buttons to other pages may also look best without a border.

<p class=para>
Be careful, though, that by removing the border, you don't diminish
your page's usability. No border means you've removed a common visual
indicator of a link, making it less easy for your readers to find the
links on the page. Browsers will change the mouse cursor as readers
pass it over an image that is a hyperlink, but you should not assume
they will, nor should you make readers test your borderless images to
find hidden links.

<p class=para>
We strongly recommend that you use
some additional way with borderless images to let your readers know
to click the images. Even including simple text instructions will
go a long way to making your pages more accessible to readers.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.9">The height and width attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Normally, a graphical browser determines the size
of an image and, hence, the rectangular space to reserve for it
in the display window, by retrieving the image file and extracting
its embedded height and width specifications. This is not the most
efficient way to render a document since the browser must sequentially
examine each image file and calculate its screen space before rendering
adjacent and subsequent document content. That can significantly
increase the amount of time it takes to render the document and
delay scanning by the user.

<p class=para>
A more efficient way for
HTML authors to specify an image's dimensions is with the
height and width <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> attributes. That way, the
browser can calculate and reserve space before actually downloading
an image, speeding document rendering. Both attributes require an
integer value that indicates the image size in pixels; the order
in which they appear in the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag is not important.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.10">Resizing and flood-filling images</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A hidden feature of the height
and width attributes is that you don't need to specify
the actual image dimensions; the attribute values can be larger
or smaller than the actual size of the image. The browser automatically
scales the image to fit the predefined space. This gives you a down-and-dirty
way of creating thumbnail versions of large images and a way to
enlarge very small pictures. Be careful, though: the browser still
must download the entire file, no matter what its final rendered
size is, and you will distort an image if you don't retain
its original height versus width proportions.

<p class=para>
Another
trick with height and width provides an easy way to flood-fill areas
of your page and can also improve document performance. Suppose
you want to insert a colored bar across your document.[5] Rather than create an image to the full dimensions,
create one that is just one pixel high and wide and set it to the
desired color. Then use the height and width attributes to scale
it to the larger size:

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[5] 
This
is one way to create colored horizontal rules in Netscape 3 or earlier,
which don't support the color attribute of the <tt>&lt;hr&gt;</TT>
tag.
</blockquote>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img src="pics/one-pixel.gif" width=640 height=20&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The
smaller image downloads much faster than a full-scale image, and
the width and height attributes create the desired bar after the
tiny image arrives at the browser (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-17">Figure 5.17</A>).

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-17">Figure 5.17: This bar was made from a one-pixel image</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0517.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-17]" width=500 height=143 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
One last trick with the width attribute is
to use a percentage value instead of an absolute pixel value. This
causes the browser to scale the image to a percentage of the document
window width. Thus, to create a colored bar 20 pixels high and the
width of the window, you could use:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img src="pics/one-pixel.gif" width="100%" height=20&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
As the document window changes size, the image will change
size as well.

<p class=para>
If you provide a percentage width and
omit the height, the browser will retain the image's aspect
ratio as it grows and shrinks. This means that the height will always
be in the correct proportion to the width and the image will display
without distortion.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.11">Problems with height and width</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Although the
height and width attributes for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag
can improve performance and let you perform some neat tricks, there
is a particularly knotty downside to using them. The browser sets
aside the specified rectangle of space to the prescribed dimensions
in the display window even if the user has turned off automatic
download of images. What the user often is left with is a page full
of semi-empty frames with meaningless picture placeholder icons
inside. The page looks terribly unfinished and is mostly useless.
Without accompanying dimensions, on the other hand, the browser
simply inserts a placeholder icon inline with the surrounding text,
so at least there's something there to read in the display.

<p class=para>
We don't have an answer to this dilemma, other than
to insist that you use the alt attribute with some descriptive text
so that users at least know what they are missing (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.3">the section called "The alt attribute"</A>).
We do recommend that you include these size attributes because we
encourage any practice that improves network performance.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.12">The hspace and vspace attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Graphical
browsers usually don't give you much space between an image
and the text around it. And unless you create a transparent image
border that expands the space between them, the typical two-pixel
buffer between an image and adjacent text is just too close for
most designers' comfort. Add the image into a hyperlink,
and the special colored border will negate any transparent buffer
space you labored to create, as well as draw even more attention
to how close the adjacent text butts up against the image.

<p class=para>
The hspace and vspace attributes can give your images breathing
room. With hspace, you specify the number of pixels of extra space
to leave between the image and text on the left and right sides
of the image; the vspace value is the number of pixels on the top
and bottom. <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-18">Figure 5.18</A> shows the difference between

<p class=para>
The ismap and usemap attributes for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag
tell the browser that the image is a special mouse-selectable visual
map of one or more hyperlinks, commonly known as an <i class=emphasis>image
map</I>. The ismap style of image maps, known as a <i class=emphasis>server-side</I> image map, may only be specified within an
<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag hyperlink. [<a href="ch07_03.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-3.1">the section called "The <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

<p class=para>
For example:

<div class=screen>

  &lt;img src="pics/map2.gif" ismap&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The browser automatically sends the x,y position of the mouse
(relative to the upper-left corner of the image) to the server when
the user clicks somewhere on the ismap image. Special server software
(the <i class=filename>/cgi-bin/images/map2</i> program in the example)
may then use those coordinates to determine a response.

<p class=para>
The usemap attribute provides a <i class=emphasis>client-side</I>
image map mechanism that effectively eliminates server-side processing
of the mouse coordinates and its incumbent network delays and
problems. Using special <tt>&lt;map&gt;</TT> and
<tt>&lt;area&gt;</TT> tags, HTML authors provide a map of
coordinates for the hyperlink-sensitive regions in the usemap image
along with related hyperlink URLs. The value of the usemap attribute
is a URL that points to that special <tt>&lt;map&gt;</TT>
section. The browser on the user's computer translates the coordinates
of a click of the mouse on the image into some action, including
loading and displaying another document. [<a href="ch07_05.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-5.3">the section called "The <tt>&lt;map&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

<p class=para>
For
example, the following source specially encodes the 100-pixel wide
by 100-pixel tall map2.gif image into four segments, each of which,
if clicked by the user, links to a different document. Also notice
that we've included, validly, the ismap image map processing
capability in the example <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag so that users
of other, usemap-incapable browsers have access to the alternative,
server-side mechanism to process the image map:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="/cgi-bin/images/map2"&gt;
  &lt;img src="pics/map2.gif" ismap usemap="#map2"&gt;

&lt;/map&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Geographical
maps make excellent ismap and usemap examples: browsing a nationwide
company's pages, for instance, the user might click on
their home town on a map to get the addresses and phone numbers
for nearby retail outlets. The advantage of the usemap client-side
image map processing is that it does not require a server or special
server software and so, unlike the ismap mechanism, can be used
in non-web (networkless) environments, such as local files or CD-ROM.

There are four <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT>
attributes currently supported by Netscape that let you use JavaScript
to manipulate the image. The first is the 
name
attribute, which lets you label the image so that it can be referenced
by a JavaScript applet. For example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img src="pics/kumquat.gif" name="kumquat"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
lets you
later refer to that picture of a kumquat as simply "kumquat"
in a JavaScript applet perhaps to erase or otherwise modify
it. You cannot individually manipulate an image with JavaScript
if it is not named.

<p class=para>
The other three attributes let you
provide JavaScript 
event handlers. The value of the attribute is
a chunk of JavaScript code, enclosed in quotation marks; it may
consist of one or more JavaScript expressions, separated by semicolons.

<p class=para>
Netscape invokes the 
onAbort
event handler if the user stops loading an image, usually by clicking
the browser's "stop" button. You might,
for instance, use an onAbort message to warn users if they stop
loading some essential image, such as an image map (see <a href="ch07_05.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-5">the section called "Mouse-Sensitive Images"</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img src="pics/kumquat.gif" usemap="#map1" onAbort="window.alert"('Caution: This image contains important
   hyperlinks. Please load the entire image.')"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The onError attribute is invoked if some error
occurs during the loading of the image, but not for a missing image
or one that the user chose to stop loading. Presumably, the applet
could attempt to recover from the error or load a different image
in its place.

<p class=para>
Netscape executes the JavaScript code
associated with the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag's 
onLoad attribute right after the browser successfully
loads and displays the image.

<p class=para>
See <a href="ch13_03.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-3.3">the section called "JavaScript Event Handlers"</A> for more information
about JavaScript and event handlers.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.15">Combining <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You may combine any of the various standard and extension
attributes for images where and when they make sense. The order
for inclusion of multiple attributes in the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT>
tag is not important, either. Just be careful not to use redundant
attributes or you won't be able to predict the outcome.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7">Video Extensions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
special controls, dynsrc, loop, and start attribute extensions for
the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag are unique to Internet Explorer
and are extensions to the HTML 3.2 standard. They let you embed
an inline movie into the body content, just like an image.

<p class=para>
Equivalent
behavior is available in Netscape via an extension program known
as a 
plug-in. Plug-ins place an additional
burden on the user, in that each user must find and install the
appropriate plug-in before being able to view the inline video.
The Internet Explorer <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag extensions, on
the other hand, make video display an intrinsic part of the browser.
[<a href="ch13_02.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-2">the section called "Embedded Content"</A>]

<p class=para>
However, the 
Internet
Explorer movie extensions currently are very limited. They are not
supported by any other browser and can only be used with Audio Video
Interleave (AVI) formatted movie files, since that's the
player format built into Internet Explorer and enabled through Windows
95. Moreover, recent innovations in browser technology, <i class=emphasis>applets</I>
in particular, may make Internet Explorer's approach of
extending the already overloaded <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag obsolete.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.1">The dynsrc attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Use the 
dynsrc
attribute extension in the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag to reference
an AVI movie for inline display by Internet Explorer. Its required
value is the URL of the movie file enclosed in quotation marks.
For example, this text displays the tag and attribute for an AVI
movie file entitled <i class=filename>intro.avi</i>:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The browser sets aside a video viewport in the HTML display
window and plays the movie, with audio if it's included
in the clip and if your computer is able to play audio. Internet
Explorer treats dynsrc movies similar to inline images: in line
with current body content and according to the dimension of the
video frame. And, like common images, the dynsrc referenced movie
file gets displayed immediately after download from the server.
You may change those defaults and add some user controls with other
attributes, as described below.

<p class=para>
Because all other browsers
currently ignore the special Internet Explorer attributes for movies,
they may become confused by an <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag that
does not contain the otherwise required src attribute and an image
URL. We recommend that you include the src attribute and a valid
image file URL in all <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tags, including those
that reference a movie for Internet Explorer users. The other browsers
display the still image in place of the movie; Internet Explorer
does the reverse and plays the movie, but does not display the image.
Note that the order of attributes does not matter. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" src="pics/mvstill.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Internet Explorer loads and plays the AVI movie <i class=filename>intro.avi</i>;
other graphical browsers will load and display the <i class=filename>mvstill.gif</i>
image instead.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.2">The controls attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Normally, Internet
Explorer plays a movie inside a framed viewport once, without any
visible user controls. The user may restart, stop, and continue
the movie by clicking inside that viewport with the mouse. Use the

controls attribute
(no value) to add visible controls to the movie viewport so that
the user may, with the mouse, play, fast-forward, reverse, stop,
and pause the movie, like on a VCR. If the movie clip includes a
sound track, Internet Explorer provides an audio volume control
as well. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" controls src="pics/mvstill.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
adds the various playback controls to the video window of
the <i class=filename>intro.avi</i> movie clip, as shown in <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-19">Figure 5.19</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-19">Figure 5.19: The controls attribute adds movie playback controls to the video playback frame</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0519.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-19]" width=500 height=266 border=0>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.3">The loop attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Internet Explorer
normally plays a movie clip from beginning to end once after download.
The 
loop
attribute for the movie <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag lets you have
the clip play repeatedly for an integer number of times set by the
attribute's value, or forever if the value is infinite.
The user may still cut the loop short by clicking on the movie image,
by pressing the stop button, if given controls (see previous), or
by moving on to another document.

<p class=para>
The following <i class=filename>intro.avi</i>
movie clip will play from beginning to end, then restart at the
beginning and play through to the end nine more times:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" loop=10 src="pics/mvstill.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Whereas the following movie will play over and over again,
incessantly:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" loop=infinite src="pics/mvstill.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Looping movies aren't necessarily meant to annoy.
Some special effects animations, for instance, are a sequence of
repeated frames or segments. Rather than string the redundant segments
into one, long movie that extends its download time, simply loop
the single, compact frame or segment.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.4">The start attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Normally, an Internet Explorer movie
clip starts playing as soon as it's downloaded. You can
modify that behavior with the start attribute in the movie's
<tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag. By setting its value to mouseover,
you delay playback until the user passes the mouse pointer over
the movie viewport. The other valid start attribute value, fileopen,
is the default: start playback just after download. It is included
because both values may be combined in the start attribute to cause
the movie to automatically playback once after download, and then
whenever the user passes the mouse over its viewport. Add a value-separating
comma, with no intervening spaces, or else enclose them in quotes,
when combining the start attribute values.

<p class=para>
For example,
our by-now-infamous <i class=filename>intro.avi</i> movie will play
once when its host HTML document is loaded by the user, and whenever
he or she passes the mouse over the movie's viewport:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" start="fileopen,mouseover"
     src="pics/mvstill.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.7.5">Combining movie <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Treat Internet Explorer inline movies as you would any image,
mixing and matching the various movie-specific, as well as the standard
and extended <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag attributes and values supported
by the browser. For example, you might align the movie (or its image
alternate, if displayed by another browser) to the right of the
browser window:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/intro.avi" src="pics/mvstill.gif" align=right&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Combining attributes to achieve a special effect is good.
We also recommend you combine attributes to give control to the
user, when appropriate. For instance, if you set up a movie to loop
incessantly, you should also include the controls attribute so the
user can stop the movie without having to leave the HTML document.

<p class=para>
As we stated in 5.2.7.4, by combining attributes you can also
delay playback until the user passes the mouse over its viewport.
Magically, the movie comes alive and plays continuously:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;img dynsrc="movies/magic.avi" start=mouseover
   loop=infinite src="pics/magic.gif"&gt; 
 
</PRE>
</DIV>
