<p class=para>
Ever since the publication of Vernor Vinge's ground-breaking science
fiction novelette <i class=citetitle>True Names</i> in 1978, many
computer programmers and users have been fascinated by the ideas of
"virtual reality" and "cyberspace"--computer interfaces using 3D
surround graphics with which a user could interact in something like
the way our physical bodies interact with the real world.

<p class=para>
In 1994, two Silicon Valley programmers with backgrounds in computer
graphics went public with the provocative idea that the
distributed-hypertext model of HTML might be used as a foundation for
building cyberspace. A working group began adapting and enhancing a
graphics-description language previously developed at Silicon Graphics
Inc. to be used with HTML and Web software.

<p class=para>
The result was Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). VRML follows
the HTML model in several important respects. Like HTML, VRML is a
content-based, plain-ASCII markup language that describes its universe
at a high level, and leaves it up to the browser or client program to
make detailed presentation decisions. VRML technology has since
evolved even more rapidly than the Web itself. As of April 1997,
Microsoft was in the process of extending the VRML standard, and
support for an earlier version of VRML was available as an add-on for
the popular Netscape browser for PCs.

<p class=para>
VRML documents describe worlds populated with 3D shapes. Developers
build objects from basic shapes, such as cubes, cones, and spheres,
with a variety of surface effects, including texture maps and
lighting, available for composing realistic objects. It's possible to
associate URLs with objects in a VRML world in such a way that when a
user touches the object, they are transported to another VRML world,
an HTML document, or a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script (which
itself may generate a VRML world).

<p class=para>
Some intriguing demonstration interfaces to large databases have
already been built and suggest the beginnings of true cyberspace
architecture. So far, however, these demonstrations fall short of the
strong virtual-reality experience depicted in science-fiction books
and movies. Three related problems bar the way. The design problem is
that VRML currently has no capacity to do animation. VRML worlds are
static. While it's easy to move the user's viewpoint in a VRML world,
the only way to actually move or alter a VRML object is to generate an
entirely new document and render it. Proposals to support animation
description are in the works, but none have yet been adopted as of
April 1997.  This may well have changed by the time this book arrives
in bookstores.

<p class=para>
The second, practical problem is that reasonably priced desktop
machines in 1997 simply don't have the capacity to do realistic
animation of general scenes. The computational cost of point-plotting,
hidden-line elimination, texture-mapping, and lighting calculations
gets very large, very quickly. Companies that care about animation,
like Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic, use multimillion-dollar
special-purpose supercomputers for this job because they have
to. Current VRML browsers, for example, frequently have to drop back
from full-surface rendering to wireframe mode when moving the viewer's
eyepoint. Even without animation, rendering of static images including
texture-mapping, spheres and sculpted surfaces, can take many seconds,
which is unacceptably slow.

<p class=para>
The third problem is that VRML worlds are not yet shared spaces. For
virtual reality to begin to approach the interactive richness of the
real world, it must be possible to interact in a VRML world not merely
with objects but with the "avatar" or cyberspatial manifestations of
other users. This is an area of very active interest to the VRML
developers (many of whom have been directly inspired by the Black Sun
environment depicted in Neil Stephenson's immensely popular science
fiction novel, <i class=citetitle>Snow Crash</i>), but no single
solution has yet emerged. (There are other, comparatively minor
problems: VRML has no sound capability, for example. But it's easy to
imagine a solution for this one within current technology.)

<p class=para>
Thus, VRML is still currently more a promise and a technology
direction than a complete answer to the virtual-reality question. But
the trend-curves of desktop hardware performance and the amount of
money being poured into better multimedia graphics accelerators make
it one worth watching carefully. With another few years' hardware
evolution and a few foreseeable VRML language enhancements, a true
distributed cyberspace, built around and using WWW servers, may well
be within our reach.
