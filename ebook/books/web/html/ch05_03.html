<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3">5.3 Document Colors and Background Images</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The HTML 3.2 standard provides a number
of attributes for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag that allow the
HTML author to define text, link, and document background colors,
in addition to defining an image to be used as the document background.
Internet Explorer extends these attributes to include document margins
and better background image control. And, of course, the latest
style sheet technologies integrated into the current browsers let
you manipulate all these various display parameters.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1">Extensions to the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The attributes that control the document
background, text color, and document margins are used with the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag. [<a href="ch03_07.html#HTML-CH-3-SECT-7.1">the section called "The <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.1">The bgcolor attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You can change the default background color in the browser window to
another hue with the bgcolor attribute for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag. Like the color attribute for the <tt>&lt;font&gt;</TT> tag, the
required value of the bgcolor attribute may be expressed in either of
two ways: as the red, green, and blue (RGB) components of the desired
color or as a standard color name. <a href="appf_01.html">Appendix F, <i>Color Names and Values</i></A>,
provides a complete discussion of RGB color encoding along with a
table of acceptable color names you can use with the bgcolor
attribute.

<p class=para>
Setting the
background color is easy. To get a pure red background using RGB
encoding, try:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body bgcolor="#FF0000"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
For a more subtle background, try:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body bgcolor=peach&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.2">The background attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
If
a splash of color isn't enough, you may also place an image
into the background of a document with the background attribute
in its <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
The required value
of the background attribute is the URL of an image. The browser
automatically repeats (tiles) the image both horizontally and vertically
to fill the entire window.

<p class=para>
You normally should choose
a small, somewhat dim image to create an interesting but unobtrusive
background pattern. Besides, a small, simple image traverses the
network much faster than an intricate, full-screen image.

<p class=para>
<a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-20">Figure 5.20</A>
shows you how the extended browsers repeatedly render a single brick
to create a wall of bricks for the document background:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body background="pics/onebrick.gif"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-20">Figure 5.20: One brick becomes many in a Netscape background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0520.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-20]" width=500 height=220 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Background images of various dimensions and
sizes create interesting vertical and horizontal effects on the
page. For instance, a tall skinny image might set off your document
heading:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body background="pics/vertical_fountain.gif"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kumquat Lore&lt;/h3&gt;
For centuries, many myths and legends have arisen around the kumquat.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the <i class=filename>vertical_fountain.gif</i>
is a narrow, tall image whose color grows lighter towards its base
and whose length exceeds the length of the document body, the resulting
document might look like the one shown in <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-21">Figure 5.21</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-21">Figure 5.21: A tall and skinny background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0521.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-21]" width=500 height=252 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can achieve a similar effect horizontally
with an image that is much wider than it is long (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-22">Figure 5.22</A>).

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-22">Figure 5.22: A long and skinny background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0522.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-22]" width=500 height=252 border=0>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.3">The bgproperties attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The

bgproperties attribute extension for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag is exclusive to Internet Explorer and only works in conjunction
with the background attribute extension. The bgproperties attribute
has a single value, fixed. It freezes the background image to the
browser window, so it does not scroll with the other window contents.
Hence, the example <i class=filename>H2Omark.gif</i> background image
servers as a watermark for the document:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body background="pics/H2Omark.gif" bgproperties="fixed"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.4">The text attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Once
you alter a document's background color or add a background
image, you also might need to adjust the text color to ensure that
users can read the text. The text attribute for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag does just that: it sets the color of all nonanchor text in the
entire document.

<p class=para>
Give the text attribute a color value
in the same format as you use to specify a background color (see
bgcolor above)--an RGB triplet or color name, as described
in <a href="appf_01.html">Appendix F, <i>Color Names and Values</i></A>.
For example, to produce a document with blue text on a pale yellow
background, use:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body bgcolor="#777700" text="blue"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Of course,
it's best to select a text color that contrasts well with
your background color or image.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.5">The link, vlink, and alink attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The
link, vlink, and alink attributes of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag control the color of hypertext (<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag) in
your documents. All three accept values that specify a color as
an RGB triplet or color name, just like the text and bgcolor attributes.

<p class=para>
The 
link attribute
determines the color of all hyperlinks the user has not yet followed.
The 
vlink attribute
sets the color of all links the extended browser user had followed
at one time or another. The 
alink
attribute defines a color for active link text--one that
is currently selected by the user and is under the mouse cursor
with the mouse button depressed.

<p class=para>
Like text color, you
should be careful to select link colors that can be read against
the document background. Moreover, the link colors should be different
from the regular text as well as from each other.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.6">The leftmargin attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Peculiar to
Internet Explorer, the 
leftmargin
attribute extension for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag lets you
indent the left margin relative to the left edge of the browser's
window, much like a margin on a sheet of paper. Other browsers ignore
this attribute and normally left-justified body content abuts the
left edge of the document window.

<p class=para>
The value of the
leftmargin attribute is the integer number of pixels for that left-margin
indent; a value of 0 is the default. The margin is filled with the
background color or image.

<p class=para>
For example, Internet Explorer
renders the following text justified against a margin 50 pixels
away from the left edge of the browser window (see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-23">Figure 5.23</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body leftmargin=50&gt;
Internet Explorer lets you indent the&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;--left margin&lt;br&gt;
away from the left edge of the window. 
&lt;/body&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-23">Figure 5.23: Internet Explorer's leftmargin attribute for indenting body content</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0523.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-23]" width=500 height=145 border=0>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.7">The topmargin attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Like leftmargin,
the 
topmargin
attribute extension currently is exclusive to Internet Explorer.
It may be included in the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to set a
margin of space at the top of the document. The margin space is
filled with the document's background color or image.

<p class=para>
Body content begins flowing below the integer number of pixels
you specify as the value for topmargin; a value of 0 is the default.

<p class=para>
For example, Internet Explorer renders the following
text at least 50 pixels down from the top edge of the browser window
(see <a href="#HTML-CH-5-FIG-24">Figure 5.24</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body topmargin=50&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&lt;/center&gt;
Internet Explorer can give your documents 
a little extra headroom. 
&lt;/body&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-FIG-24">Figure 5.24: Internet Explorer's topmargin attribute for lowering body content</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0524.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-24]" width=500 height=156 border=0>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.8">The style and class attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You also can
set all the various style-related <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> features
and then some with HTML style sheets. But, although you may include
the style attribute with the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to create
an inline style for the entire body content, we recommend that you
set the styles for the entire document body at the document level
(<tt>&lt;style&gt;</TT> tag inside the document head) or via
a collection-level (imported) style sheet. Use the class attribute
and name value to apply the appropriate style of a predefined class
of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to the contents. (Since there
can only be one body per document, what is the point of setting
a class name otherwise?) We cover the use of style and class definitions
in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></A>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.1.9">Mixing and matching body attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Although

background
and bgcolor attributes can appear in the same <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag, a background image will effectively hide the selected background
color unless the image contains substantial portions of transparent
areas, as we described earlier in this chapter. But even if the
image does hide the background color, go ahead and include the bgcolor
attribute and some appropriate color value. That's because
users can turn off image downloading, which includes background
images, and so they may find your page otherwise left naked and
unappealing. Moreover, without a bgcolor attribute or a downloaded
(for whatever reason) background image, the browsers merrily ignore
your text and link color attributes, too, reverting instead to its
own default values, or the ones chosen by the user.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.2">Extending a Warning</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The various color
and image extensions work wonderfully, particularly the colorful
ones, assuming that all users have a 256-color display, lots of
available memory, unlimited network bandwidth, and good visual acuity.
In reality, many users have monochrome or limited color displays,
limited memory for caching images, extremely restricted network
bandwidth, and poor vision.

<p class=para>
Because of these limitations,
you should seriously consider not using any of these extensions
in your documents. Much like early users of the Macintosh felt compelled
to create documents using ransom-note typography ("I've
got 40 fonts on this thing, and I'm going to use them all!"),
many authors cannot avoid adding some sort of textured background
to every document they create ("I've got 13 wood
grains and 22 kinds of marbling, and I'm going to use them
all!").

<p class=para>
In reality, except for the very clever
ones, texture-mapped backgrounds add no information to your documents.
The value of your document ultimately lies in its text and imagery,
not the cheesy blue swirly pattern in the background. No matter
how cool it looks, your readers are not benefiting and could be
losing readability.

<p class=para>
We advise you not to use the color
extensions except for comparatively frivolous endeavors or unless
the extension really adds to the document's value, such
as for business advertising and marketing pages.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.2.1">Problems with background images</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Here are some of the things that can go wrong with
background images:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>The time to load the document is increased
by the amount of time needed to load the image. Until the background
image is completely downloaded, no further document rendering is
possible.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The background image takes up room in the browser's
local cache, displacing other images that might actually contain
useful information. This makes other documents, which might not
even have backgrounds, take that much longer to load.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The colors in the image may not be available on
the user's display, forcing the browser to dither the image.
This replaces large areas of a single color with repeating patterns
of several other closer, but not cleaner, colors and can make the
text more difficult to read.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Because the browser must actually display an image
in the background, as opposed to filling an area with a single color,
scrolling through the document can take much longer.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Even if it's clear onscreen, text printed
on top of an image invariably is more difficult, if not impossible,
to read.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Fonts vary widely between machines; the ones you
use with your browser that work fine with a background pattern often
end up jagged and difficult to read on another machine.

<p>
</UL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.2.2">Problems with background, text, and link colors</A></h4>

<p class=para>
There also are a slew of problems you will encounter if you
play with background colors, including:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>The color you choose, while just lovely
in your eyes, may look terrible to the user. Why annoy them by changing
what users most likely have already set as their own default background
color?

<p>
<li class=listitem>While you may be a member of the "light
text on a dark background" school of document design, many
people also favor the "dark text on a light background"
style that has been consistently popular for over three thousand
years. Instead of bucking the trend, assume that the user has already
set their browser to a comfortable color scheme.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Some users are color-blind. What may be a nifty-looking
combination of colors to you may be completely unreadable to others.
One combination in particular to avoid is green for unvisited links
and red for visited links. Millions of men are afflicted with red/green
color blindness.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Your brilliant hue may not be available on the user's
display, and the browser may be forced to choose one that's
close instead. For displays with very few colors (like those of
several million 16-color VGA Windows-based machines currently in
use) the close colors for the text and the background might be the
same color!

<p>
<li class=listitem>For the same reasons above, active, unvisited, and
visited links may all wind up as the same color on limited-color
displays.

<p>
<li class=listitem>By changing text colors, particularly those for
visited and unvisited links, you may completely confuse the user.
By changing those colors, you effectively force them to experiment
with your page, clicking a few links here and there to learn your
color scheme.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Most page designers have no formal training in cognitive
psychology, fine arts, graphic arts, or industrial design, yet feel
fully capable of selecting appropriate colors for their documents.
If you must fiddle with the colors, ask a professional to pick them
for you.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-5-SECT-3.2.3">And then again</A></h4>

<p class=para>
There is no denying the
fact that these extensions result in some very stunning HTML documents.
And they are fun to explore and play with. So, rather than leave
this section on a sour note of caution, we encourage you to go ahead
and play--just play carefully.
