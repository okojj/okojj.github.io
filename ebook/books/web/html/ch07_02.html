<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2">7.2 Referencing Documents: The URL</A></h2>

<p class=para>
As we discussed earlier,
every document on the World Wide Web has a unique address. (Imagine
the chaos if they didn't.) The document's address
is known as its <i class=emphasis>uniform resource locator</I> (URL).[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
"URL" usually is pronounced "you
are ell," not "earl."
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Several HTML tags include a URL attribute value, including
hyperlinks, inline images, and forms. All use the same URL syntax
to specify the location of a Web resource, regardless of the type
or content of that resource. That's why it's known
as a <i class=emphasis>uniform</I> resource locator.

<p class=para>
Since
they can be used to represent almost any resource on the Internet,
URLs come in a variety of flavors. All URLs, however, have the same
top-level syntax:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<i class=emphasis>scheme:scheme_specific_part</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>scheme</I> describes the kind of object
the URL references; the <i class=emphasis>scheme_specific_part</I>
is, well, the part that is peculiar to the specific scheme. The
important thing to note is that the <i class=emphasis>scheme</I>
is always separated from the <i class=emphasis>scheme_specific_part</I>
by a colon with no intervening spaces.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.1">Writing a URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
URLs are written using
the displayable characters in the US-ASCII character set. If you
need to use a character in a URL that is not part of this character
set, you must encode the character using a special notation. The
encoding notation replaces the desired character with three characters:
a 
percent sign and
two hexadecimal digits whose value corresponds to the position of
the character in the ASCII character set.

<p class=para>
This is easier
than it sounds. One of the most common encoded special characters
is the space character, whose position in the character set is 20
hexadecimal. To encode a space in a URL, replace it with %20:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/new%20pricing.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This URL actually retrieves a document named <i class=emphasis>new
pricing.html</I> from the server.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.1.1">Handling reserved and unsafe characters</A></h4>

<p class=para>
In
addition to the nonprinting characters, you'll need to
encode reserved and unsafe characters in your URLs as well.

<p class=para>
Reserved characters are those characters that have a specific
meaning within the URL itself. For example, many URLs use the 
slash
character to separate elements of a pathname within the URL. If
you need to include a slash in a URL that is not intended to be
an element separator, you'll need to encode it as %2F:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.calculator.com/compute?3%2f4
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This URL actually references the resource named <i class=emphasis>compute</I>
on the <i class=emphasis>www.calculator.com</I> server and passes
the string 3/4 to it, as delineated by the 
question mark (?). Presumably, the resource is
actually a server-side program that performs some arithmetic function
on the passed value and returns a result.

<p class=para>
Unsafe characters
are those that have no special meaning within the URL, but may have
a special meaning in the context in which the URL is written. For
example, the double quotation mark character (
")
is used to delimit URLs in many HTML tags. If you were to include
a double quotation mark directly in a URL, you would probably confuse
the HTML browser. Instead, encode the double quotation mark as %22
to avoid any possible conflict.

<p class=para>
Other reserved and unsafe characters that
should always be encoded are shown in <a href="#HTML-CH-7-TAB-1">Table 7.1</A>.

<p class=para>
In general, you should always encode a character
if there is some doubt as to whether it can be placed as-is in a
URL. As a rule of thumb, any character other than a letter, number,
or any of the characters $-_.+!*'(),
should be encoded.

<p class=para>
It is never an error to encode a
character, unless that character has a specific meaning in the URL.
For example, encoding the slashes in an http URL will cause them
to be used as regular characters, not as pathname delimiters, breaking
the URL.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2">The http URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The http URL
is, by far, the most common within the World Wide Web. It is used
to access documents stored on an http server, and it has two formats:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://<i class=emphasis>server:port/path#fragment</I>
http://<i class=emphasis>server:port/path?search</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Some of the parts are optional. In fact, the most common form
of the http URL simply is:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://<i class=emphasis>server/path</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
designating the unique server and the directory path and name
of a document.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.1">The http server</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>server</I> is the unique Internet name or
Internet Protocol (IP) numerical address of the computer system that
stores the Web resource. Like us, we suspect you'll mostly use more
easily remembered Internet names for the servers in your URLs.

<p class=para>
Each Internet-connected computer has a unique address; a numeric (IP)
address, of course, because computers deal only in numbers. Humans
prefer names, so the Internet folks provide us with a collection of
special servers and software (Domain Name System or DNS) that
automatically resolve Internet names into IP addresses. InterNIC, a
nonprofit agency, registers domain names mostly on a first-come,
first-serve basis, and distributes new names to DNS servers worldwide.

<p class=para>
The name consists of several parts, including the server's actual name
and the successive names of its network domain, each part separated by
a period. Typical Internet names look like
<i class=emphasis>www.ora.com</I> or
<i class=emphasis>hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu</I>.[3]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
In the United States and for some Canadian establishments, the
three-letter suffix of the domain name identifies the type of
organization or business that operates that portion of the
Internet. For instance, "com" is a commercial enterprise; "edu" is an
academic institution; and "gov" identifies a government-based
domain. Outside the United States, a less-descriptive suffix is
assigned; typically a two-letter abbreviation of the country name:
"jp" for Japan and "de" for Deutschland, for instance. That convention
indicates the traditional distribution of the Internet and presumably
will change dramatically as the network proliferates in the rest of
the world.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
It has become something of a convention that webmasters name their
servers <i class=emphasis>www</I> for quick and easy identification on
the Web. For instance, O'Reilly &amp; Associates' web server's name is
<i class=emphasis>www</I>, which, along with the publisher's
acronym-based domain name, becomes the very easily remembered web site
<i class=emphasis>www.ora.com</I>.  Similarly, Sun Microsystems's web
server is named <i class=emphasis>www.sun.com</I>; Apple Computer's is
<i class=emphasis>www.apple.com</I>, and even Microsoft makes their web
server easily memorable as <i class=emphasis>www.microsoft.com</I>.
The naming convention has very obvious benefits, which you, too,
should take advantage of if you are called upon to create a web server
for your organization.

<p class=para>
You may also specify the address of a server using its numerical IP
address.  The address is a sequence of four numbers, zero to 255,
separated by periods. Valid IP addresses look like 137.237.1.87 or
192.249.1.33.
 

<p class=para>
It'd be a dull diversion to tell you now what the numbers mean or how
to derive an IP address from a domain name, particularly since you'll
rarely if ever use one in a URL.  Rather, this is a good place to
hyperlink: pick up any good Internet networking treatise for rigorous
detail on IP addressing, such as Ed Krol's <i class=emphasis>The Whole
Internet User's Guide and Catalog</I>, published by O'Reilly
&amp; Associates (1994, Second Edition).

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.2">The http port</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>port</I>
is the number of the communication port to which the client browser
connects to the server. It's a networking thing: servers
do many things besides serve up web documents and resources to client
browsers: electronic mail, FTP document fetches, filesystem sharing,
and so on. Although all that network activity may come into the
server on a single wire, it's typically divided into software-managed
"ports" for service-specific communications--something
analogous to boxes at your local post office.

<p class=para>
The default
URL port for web servers is 80. Special secure web servers (Secure
HTTP, SHTTP or Secure Socket Layer, SSL) run on port 443. Most web
servers today use port 80; you need only to include a port number
along with an immediately preceding colon in your URL if the target
server does <i class=emphasis>not</I> use port 80 for web communication.

<p class=para>
When the Web was in its infancy many months ago, pioneer
webmasters ran their Wild Wild Web connections on all sorts of port
numbers. For technical and security reasons, system-administrator
privileges are required to install a server on port 80. Lacking
such privileges, these webmasters chose other, more easily accessible,
port numbers.

<p class=para>
Now that web servers have become acceptable
and are under the care and feeding of responsible administrators,
documents being served on some port other than 80 or 443 should
make you wonder if that server is really on the up and up. Most
likely, the maverick server is being run by a clever user unbeknownst
to the server's bona fide system administrators.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.3">The http path</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The document <i class=emphasis>
path</I> is the UNIX-style
hierarchical location of the file in the server's storage
system. The pathname consists of one or more names separated by
slashes. All but the last name represent directories leading down
to the document; the last name is usually that of the document itself.

<p class=para>
It has become a convention that for easy identification,
HTML document names end with the suffix <i class=emphasis>.html</I>
(they're otherwise plain ASCII text files, remember?).
You can easily identify a PC-based server: their restrictions on
filenames mean you can have only the three-letter <i class=emphasis>.html</I>
name suffix for HTML documents.

<p class=para>
Although the server
name in a URL is not 
case-sensitive,
the document pathname may be. Since most web servers are run on
UNIX-based systems and UNIX file names are case-sensitive, the document
pathname will be case-sensitive, too. Web servers running on DOS
machines are not case-sensitive, so the document pathname is not,
but since it is impossible to know the operating system of the server
you are accessing, always assume that the server has case-sensitive
pathnames and take care to get the case correct when typing your
URLs.

<p class=para>
Certain conventions regarding the document pathname
have arisen. If the last element of the document path is a directory,
not a single document, the server usually will send back either
a listing of the directory contents or the HTML index document in
that directory. You should end the document name for a directory
with a trailing  
slash character, but in practice, most
servers will honor the request even if the character is omitted.

<p class=para>
If the directory name is just a slash alone or sometimes nothing
at all, you will retrieve the first (top-level) HTML document or
so-called <i class=emphasis>home
page</I> in the uppermost root directory of the server. Every
well-designed http server should have an attractive, well-designed
"home page"; it's a shorthand way for
users to access your web collection since they don't need
to remember the document's actual filename, just your server's
name. That's why, for example, you can type <i class=emphasis><a href="http://www.ora.com">http://www.ora.com</a></I>
into Netscape's "Open" dialog box and
get O'Reilly's home page.

<p class=para>
Another
twist: if the first component of the document path starts with the

tilde
character (~), it means that the rest of the pathname begins from
the personal HTML directory in the home directory of the specified
user on the server machine. For instance, the URL <i class=emphasis>http://www.kumquat.com/~chuck/</I>
would retrieve the top-level page from Chuck's document
collection.

<p class=para>
Different servers have different ways of
locating documents within a user's home directory. Many
search for the documents in a directory named <i class=emphasis>public_html</I>.
UNIX-based servers are fond of the name <i class=emphasis>index.html</I>
for home pages.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.4">The http document fragment</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>
fragment</I> is
an identifier that points to a specific section of a document. In
URL specifications, it follows the server and pathname and is separated
by the 
pound sign (#). A
fragment identifier indicates to the browser that it should begin
displaying the target document at the indicated fragment name. As
we describe in more detail below, you insert fragment names into
a document with the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag and the name attribute.
Like pathnames, a fragment name may be any sequence of characters.

<p class=para>
The fragment name and the preceding hash symbol are
optional; omit them when referencing a document without defined
fragments.

<p class=para>
Formally, the fragment element only applies
to target files that are HTML documents. If the target of the URL
is some other document type, the fragment name may be misinterpreted
by the browser.

<p class=para>
Fragments are useful for long documents.
By identifying key sections of your document with a fragment name,
you make it easy for readers to link directly to that portion of
the document, avoiding the tedium of scrolling or searching through
the document to get to the section that interests them.

<p class=para>
As
a rule of thumb, we recommend that every section header in your
documents be accompanied by an equivalent fragment name. By consistently
following this rule, you'll make it possible for readers
to jump to any section in any of your documents. Fragments also
make it easier to build tables of contents for your document families.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.5">The http search parameter</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>
search</I> component of the http
URL, along with its preceding question mark, is optional. It indicates
that the path is a searchable or executable resource on the server.
The content of the search component is passed to the server as parameters
that control the search or execution function.

<p class=para>
The
actual encoding of parameters in the search component is dependent
upon the server and the resource being referenced. The parameters
for searchable resources are covered later in this chapter, when
we discuss searchable documents. Parameters for executable resources
are discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, <i>Forms</i></A>.

<p class=para>
Although our initial presentation of http URLs indicated
that a URL can have either a fragment identifier or a search component,
some browsers let you use both in a single URL. If you so desire,
you can follow the search parameter with a fragment identifier,
telling the browser to begin displaying the results of the search
at the indicated fragment. Netscape, for example, supports this
usage.

<p class=para>
We don't recommend this kind of URL,
though. First and foremost, it doesn't work on a lot of
browsers. Just as important, using a fragment implies that you are
sure that the results of the search will have a fragment of that
name defined within the document. For large document collections,
this is hardly likely. You are better off omitting the fragment,
showing the search results from the beginning of the document, and
avoiding potential confusion among your readers.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.2.6">Sample http URLs</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Here are some sample
http URLs:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog.html">http://www.ora.com/catalog.html</a>
<a href="http://www.ora.com/">http://www.ora.com/</a>
http://www.kumquat.com:8080/
http://www.kumquat.com/planting/guide.html#soil_prep
http://www.kumquat.com/find_a_quat?state=Florida
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first example is an explicit reference to a bona fide
HTML document named <i class=emphasis>catalog.html</I> that is stored
in the root directory of the <i class=emphasis>www.ora.com</I> server.
The second references the top-level home page on that same server.
That home page may or may not be <i class=emphasis>catalog.html</I>.
Sample three, too, assumes there is a home page in the root directory
of the <i class=emphasis>www.kumquat.com</I> server, and that the
web connection is to the nonstandard port 8080.

<p class=para>
The
fourth example is the URL for retrieving the web document named
<i class=emphasis>guide.html</I> from the <i class=emphasis>planting</I>
directory on the <i class=emphasis>www.kumquat.com</I> server. Once
retrieved, the browser should display the document beginning at
the fragment named <i class=emphasis>soil_prep</I>.

<p class=para>
The
last example invokes an executable resource named <i class=emphasis>find_a_quat</I>
with the parameter named <i class=emphasis>state</I> set to the value
<i class=emphasis>Florida</I>. Presumably, this resource generates
an HTML response that is subsequently displayed by the browser.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.3">The javascript URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The javascript URL
actually is a pseudo-protocol, not usually included in discussions
of URLs. Yet, with advanced browsers like Netscape and Internet
Explorer, the javascript URL can be associated with a hyperlink
and used to execute JavaScript commands when the user
selects the link. Expect to see many examples of link-related JavaScript
effects in HTML documents on the Web. [<a href="ch13_03.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-3.4">the section called "JavaScript URLs"</A>]

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.3.1">The javascript URL arguments</A></h4>

<p class=para>
What follows
the javascript pseudo-protocol is one or more semicolon-separated
JavaScript expressions and methods, including references to multi-expression
JavaScript functions that you embed within the <tt>&lt;script&gt;</TT>
tag in your HTML documents (see <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, <i>Executable Content</i></A>, for details). For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
javascript:window.alert('Hello, world!')
javascript:doFlash('red', 'blue'); window.alert('Do not press me!')
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
are valid URLs that you may include as the value for a link
reference (see 4.1.2 and 6.4.3). The first example contains a single
JavaScript method that activates an alert dialog with the simple
message.

<p class=para>
The second javascript URL example contains
two arguments: the first calls a JavaScript function,
doFlash, which presumably you have located elsewhere in the document
within the <tt>&lt;script&gt;</TT> tag and which perhaps flashes
the background color of the document window between the red and
blue. The second expression is the same alert method as in the first
example, but with a slightly different message.

<p class=para>
The
javascript URL may appear in a hyperlink sans arguments, too. In
that case, the Netscape browser alone--not Internet Explorer--opens
a special JavaScript editor wherein the user may type in and test
the various expressions and methods.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.4">The ftp URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The ftp URL is used to retrieve documents
from an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server.[4]
It has the format:

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
FTP
is an ancient Internet protocol that dates back to the Dark Ages,
around 1975 or so. It was designed as a simple way to move files
between machines and remains popular and useful to this day. Some
people who are unable to run a true web server will place their
documents on a server that speaks FTP instead.
</blockquote>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.4.1">The ftp user and password</A></h4>

<p class=para>
FTP is an authenticated
service, meaning that you must have a valid username and password
in order to retrieve documents from a server. However, most FTP
servers also support restricted, nonauthenticated access known as
<i class=emphasis>anonymous FTP</I>.
In this mode, anyone can supply the username "anonymous"
and be granted access to a limited portion of the server's
documents. Most FTP servers also assume (but may not grant, of course)
anonymous access if the username and password are omitted.

<p class=para>
If
you are using an ftp URL to access a site that requires a username
and password, include the <i class=emphasis>user</I> and <i class=emphasis>password</I>
components in the URL, along with the colon (:) and "at"
sign (@). More commonly, you'll be accessing an
anonymous FTP server, and the user and password components can be
omitted.

<p class=para>
If you keep the user component along with the
"at" sign, but omit the password and the preceding
colon, most browsers will prompt you for a password after connecting
to the FTP server. This is the recommended way of accessing authenticated
resources on an FTP server, since it prevents others from seeing
your password.

<p class=para>
We recommend you <i class=emphasis>never</I>
place an ftp URL with a user name and password in any HTML document.
The reasoning is simple: anyone can retrieve the document, extract
the user name and password from the URL, log into the FTP server,
and tamper with its documents.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.4.2">The ftp server and port</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The ftp <i class=emphasis>server</I>
and <i class=emphasis>port</I> are bound by the same rules as the
server and port in an http URL, as described above. The server must
be a valid Internet domain name or IP address of an FTP server.
The port specifies the port on which the server is listening for
requests.

<p class=para>
If the port and its preceding colon are omitted,
the default port of 21 is used. It is necessary to specify the port
only if the FTP server is running on some port other than 21.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.4.3">The ftp path and transfer type</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>path</I>
component represents a series of directories, separated by slashes
leading to the file to be retrieved. By default, the file is retrieved
as a binary file; this can be changed by adding the <i class=emphasis>
typecode</I> (and the preceding
;type=) to the URL.

<p class=para>
If the typecode is set
to d, the path is assumed to be a directory. The browser will request
a listing of the directory contents from the server and display
this listing to the user. If the typecode is any other letter, it
is used as a parameter to the FTP type command before retrieving
the file referenced by the path. While some FTP servers may implement
other codes, most servers accept i to initiate a binary transfer
and a to treat the file as a stream of ASCII text.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.4.4">Sample ftp URLs</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Here are some sample
ftp URLs:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
ftp://www.kumquat.com/sales/pricing
ftp://bob@bobs-box.com/results;type=d
ftp://bob:secret@bobs-box.com/listing;type=a
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first example retrieves the file named <i class=emphasis>pricing</I>
from the <i class=emphasis>sales</I> directory on the anonymous FTP
server at <i class=emphasis>www.kumquat.com</I>. The second logs
into the FTP server on <i class=emphasis>bobs-box.com</I> as user
bob, prompting for a password before retrieving the contents of
the directory named <i class=emphasis>results</I> and displaying
them to the user. The last example logs into <i class=emphasis>bobs-box.com</I>
as bob with the password secret and retrieves the file named <i class=emphasis>listing</I>,
treating its contents as ASCII characters.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.5">The file URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
file URL specifies a file stored on a machine without indicating
the protocol used to retrieve the file. As such, it has limited
use in a networked environment. Its real benefit, however, is that
it can reference a file on the user's machine, and is particularly
useful for referencing personal HTML document collections, such
as those "under construction" and not yet ready
for general distribution, or HTML document collections on CD-ROM.
It has the format:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
file://<i class=emphasis>server</I>/<i class=emphasis>path</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.5.1">The file server</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The file <i class=emphasis>server</I>,
like the http server described above, must be the Internet domain
name or IP address of the machine containing the file to be retrieved.
No assumptions are made as to how the browser might contact the
machine to obtain the file; presumably the browser can make some
connection, perhaps via a Network File System or FTP, to obtain
the file.

<p class=para>
If the server is omitted, or the special
name localhost is used, the file is assumed to reside on the same
machine upon which the browser is running. In this case, the browser
simply accesses the file using the normal facilities of the local
operating system. In fact, this is the most common usage of the
file URL. By creating document families on a diskette or CD-ROM
and referencing your hyperlinks using the <i class=emphasis>file://localhost/</I>
URL, you create a distributable, standalone document collection
that does not require a network connection to use.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.5.2">The file path</A></h4>

<p class=para>
This is the path of the
file to be retrieved on the desired server. The syntax of the <i class=emphasis>path</I>
may differ based upon the operating system of the server; be sure
to encode any potentially dangerous characters in the path.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.5.3">Sample file URLs</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The file URL is easy:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
file://localhost/home/chuck/document.html
file:///home/chuck/document.html
file://marketing.kumquat.com/monthly_sales.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first URL retrieves <i class=emphasis>/home/chuck/document.html</I>
from the user's local machine. The second is identical
to the first, except we've omitted the <i class=emphasis>localhost</I>
reference to the server; the server name defaults to the local server.
Do notice, however, the extra forward slash is required for this
alternate form.

<p class=para>
The third example uses some protocol
to retrieve <i class=emphasis>monthly_sales.html</I> from the <i class=emphasis>marketing.kumquat.com</I>
server.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.6">The news URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
news URL accesses either a single message or an entire newsgroup
within the Usenet news system. It has two forms:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
news:<i class=emphasis>newsgroup</I>
news:message_id
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
An unfortunate limitation in news URLs is that they don't
allow you to specify a server for the <i class=emphasis>newsgroup</I>.
Rather, users specify their news-server resource in their browser
preferences. At one time, not long ago, Internet newsgroups were
nearly universally distributed; all news servers carried all the
same newsgroups and their respective articles, so one news server
was as good as any. Today, the sheer bulk of disk space needed to
store the daily volume of newsgroup activity is often prohibitive
for any single news server, and there's also local censorship
of newsgroups. Hence, you cannot expect that all newsgroups, and
certainly not all articles for a particular newsgroup, will be available
on the user's news server.

<p class=para>
Moreover, many
users' browsers may not be correctly configured to read
news. We recommend you avoid placing news URLs in your documents
except in rare cases.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.6.1">Accessing entire newsgroups</A></h4>

<p class=para>
There are
several thousand newsgroups devoted to nearly every conceivable
topic under the sun and beyond. Each group has a unique name, composed
of hierarchical elements separated by periods. For example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
comp.infosys.www.announce
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
is
the World Wide Web announcements newsgroup. To access this group,
use the URL:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
news:comp.infosys.www.announce
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.6.2">Accessing single messages</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Every message
on a news server has a unique message identifier (ID) associated
with it. This ID has the form:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<i class=emphasis>unique_string@server</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>unique_string</I> is a sequence of ASCII
characters; the server is usually the name of the machine from which
the message originated. The <i class=emphasis>unique_string</I> must
be unique among all the messages that originated from the server.
A sample URL to access a single message might be:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
news:12A7789B@news.kumquat.com
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In general, message IDs are cryptic sequences of characters
not readily understood by humans. Moreover, the lifespan of a message
on a server is usually measured in days, after which the message
is deleted and the message ID is no longer valid. The bottom line:
single message news URLs are difficult to create, become invalid
quickly, and are generally not used.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.7">The nntp URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The 
nntp
URL goes beyond the news URL to provide a complete mechanism for
accessing articles in the Usenet news system. It has the form:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
nntp://<i class=emphasis>server:port/newsgroup/article</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.7.1">The nntp server and port</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The nntp <i class=emphasis>server</I>
and <i class=emphasis>port</I> are defined similarly to the http
server and port, described earlier. The server must be the Internet
domain name or IP address of a nntp server; the port is the port
on which that server is listening for requests.

<p class=para>
If
the port and its preceding colon are omitted, the default port of
119 is used.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.7.2">The nntp newsgroup and article</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>newsgroup</I>
is the name of the group from which an article is to be retrieved,
as defined in 6.2.6.

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>article</I>
is the numeric id of the desired article within that newsgroup.
Although the article number is easier to determine than a message
id, it falls prey to the same limitations of single message references
using the news URL, above. Specifically, articles do not last long
on most nntp servers, and nntp URLs quickly become invalid as a
result.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.7.3">Sample nntp URLs</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A sample nntp URL might
be:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
nntp://news.kumquat.com/alt.fan.kumquats/417
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This URL retrieves article 417 from the <i class=emphasis>alt.fan.kumquats</I>
newsgroup on <i class=emphasis>news.kumquat.com</I>. Keep in mind
that the article will only be served to machines that are allowed
to retrieve articles from this server. In general, most nntp servers
restrict access to those machines on that same local area network.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.8">The mailto URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The 
mailto URL causes
an electronic mail message to be transmitted to a named recipient.
It has the format:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
mailto:<i class=emphasis>address</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>address</I> is any valid email address,
usually of the form:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<i class=emphasis>user@server</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Thus,
a typical mailto URL might look like:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Browsers
like Netscape honor multiple recipients in the mailto URL, separated
by a comma. For example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com,booktech@ora.com,archive@myserver.com
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
will address the message to all three recipients. There should
be no spaces before or after the commas in the URL.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.8.1">Defining mail header fields</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Most browsers
open an email composition window when the user selects a mailto
URL. The recipient's address is filled in, taken from the
URL, but the message subject and various other header fields are
left blank. Many webmasters would like to fill in these fields as
a courtesy to their readers, but the URL standard provides no way
to do this.

<p class=para>
The modern browsers extend the mailto URL
to fill this gap. By adding CGI-like parameters to the mailto header,
you can set the value of the subject with Netscape and Internet
Explorer, and also cc (carbon copy) and bcc (blind carbon copy)
fields for the mail message with Netscape. All of these URLs work
with Netscape; only the first one works correctly with Internet
Explorer. [<a href="ch10_01.html#HTML-CH-10-SECT-1.1.7">the section called "Passing parameters explicitly"</A>]

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com?subject=Loved your book!
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com?cc=booktech@ora.com
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com?bcc=archive@myserver.com
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
As you can probably guess, the first URL sets the subject
of the message. Note that spaces are allowed; you don't
have to replace them with the hexadecimal equivalent %20.
The second URL places the address booktech@ora.com in the
cc field of a Netscape message. Similarly, the last example sets
the bcc field of the message.You may also set several fields in
one URL by separating the field definitions with ampersands. For
example,

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
mailto:cmusciano@aol.com?subject=Loved your book!&amp;cc=booktech@ora.com&amp; bcc=archive@myserver.com
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
sets
the subject and carbon-copy address. (This line would normally appear
as a single line but is broken here due to the width of the page.)

<p class=para>
Internet Explorer Version 3 does not recognize the bcc and
cc fields in the mailto URL and will either complain about them
if they appear alone, or will append them to a preceding subject.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.9">The telnet URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The 
telnet URL opens an interactive session with a desired
server, allowing the user to log in and use the machine. Often,
the connection to the machine automatically starts a specific service
for the user; in other cases, the user must know the commands to
type to use the system. The telnet URL has the form:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
telnet://<i class=emphasis>user:password@server:port</I>/
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.9.1">The telnet user and password</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The telnet
<i class=emphasis>user</I> and <i class=emphasis>password</I> are
used exactly like the user and password components of the ftp URL,
described previously. In particular, the same caveats apply regarding
protecting your password and never placing it within a URL.

<p class=para>
Just like the ftp URL, if you omit the password from the URL,
the browser should prompt you for a password just before contacting
the telnet server.

<p class=para>
If you omit both the user and password,
the telnet occurs without supplying a user name. For some servers,
telnet automatically connects to a default service when no user
name is supplied. For others, the browser may prompt for a username
and password when making the connection to the telnet server.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.9.2">The telnet server and port</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The telnet
<i class=emphasis>server</I> and <i class=emphasis>port</I> are defined
similarly to the http server and port, described above. The server
must be the Internet domain name or IP address of a telnet server;
the port is the port on which that server is listening for requests.

<p class=para>
If the port and its preceding colon are omitted, the
default port of 23 is used.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.10">The gopher URL</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Gopher is a web-like document
retrieval system that achieved some popularity on the Internet just
before the World Wide Web took off, completely replacing Gopher.
Some Gopher servers still exist, though, and the 
gopher URL lets you access Gopher documents. The
gopher URL has the form:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
gopher://<i class=emphasis>server:port</I>/<i class=emphasis>path</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.10.1">The gopher server and port</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The gopher
<i class=emphasis>server</I> and <i class=emphasis>port</I> are defined
similarly to the http server and port, described previously. The
server must be the Internet domain name or IP address of a gopher
server; the port is the port on which that server is listening for
requests.

<p class=para>
If the port and its preceding colon are omitted,
the default port of 70 is used.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.10.2">The gopher path</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The path can take one
of three forms:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
type/selector
type/selector%09search
type/selector%09search%09gopherplus
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>type</I> is a single character value
denoting the type of the gopher resource. If the entire path is
omitted from the gopher URL, the type defaults to 1.

<p class=para>
The
<i class=emphasis>selector</I> corresponds to the path of a resource
on the Gopher server. It may be omitted, in which case the top-level
index of the Gopher server is retrieved.

<p class=para>
If the Gopher
resource is actually a Gopher search engine, the <i class=emphasis>search</I>
component provides the string for which to search. The search string
must be preceded by an encoded horizontal tab (%09).

<p class=para>
If the Gopher server supports Gopher+ resources,
the <i class=emphasis>gopherplus</I> component supplies the necessary
information to locate that resource. The exact content of this component
varies based upon the resources on the gopher server. This component
is preceded by an encoded horizontal tab (%09). If you
want to include the <i class=emphasis>gopherplus</I> component but
omit the search component, you must still supply both encoded tabs
within the URL.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.11">Absolute and Relative URLs</A></h3>

<p class=para>
URLs
come in two flavors: absolute and relative. An absolute URL is the
complete address of a resource and has everything your system needs
to find a document and its server on the Web. At the very least,
an absolute URL contains the scheme and all required elements of
the <i class=emphasis>scheme_specific_part</I> of the URL. It may
also contain any of the optional portions of the <i class=emphasis>scheme_specific_part</I>.

<p class=para>
With a relative URL you provide an abbreviated document
address that, when automatically combined with a "base
address" by the system, becomes a complete address for
the document. Within the relative URL, any component of the URL
may be omitted. The browser automatically fills in the missing pieces
of the relative URL using corresponding elements of a base URL.
This base URL is usually the URL of the document containing the
relative URL, but may be another document specified with the <tt>&lt;base&gt;</TT>
tag. [<a href="ch07_07.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-7.1">the section called "The <tt>&lt;base&gt;</TT> Header Element"</A>]

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.11.1">Relative schemes and servers</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A common
form of a relative URL is missing the scheme and server name. Since
many related documents are on the same server, it makes sense to
omit the scheme and server name from the relative URL. For instance,
assume the base document was last retrieved from the server <i class=emphasis>www.kumquat.com</I>.
The relative URL, then:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
another-doc.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
is equivalent
to the absolute URL:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/another-doc.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<a href="#HTML-CH-7-TAB-2">Table 7.2</A> shows how the base and relative

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-7-SECT-2.11.2">Relative document directories</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Another
common form of a relative URL omits the leading slash and one or
more directory names from the beginning of the document pathname.
The directory of the base URL is automatically assumed to replace
these missing components. It's the most common abbreviation
because most HTML authors place their collection of documents and
subdirectories of support resources in the same directory path as
the home page. For example, you might have a <i class=emphasis>special/</I>
subdirectory containing FTP files referenced in your HTML document.
Let's say that the absolute URL for that HTML document
is:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/planting/guide.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A relative URL for the file <i class=emphasis>README.txt</I>
in the <i class=emphasis>special/</I> subdirectory, then, looks like
this:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
ftp:special/README.txt
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You'll
actually be retrieving:

<p class=para>
Relative URLs are
more than just a typing convenience. Because they are relative to
the current server and directory, you can move the entire set of
documents to another directory or even another server and never
have to change a single relative link. Imagine the difficulties
if you had to go into every source HTML document and change the
URL for every link every time you move it. We'd loathe
using hyperlinks! Use relative URLs wherever possible.
