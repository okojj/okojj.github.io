<p class=para>
Depending on our mood, when people ask us about the
"new" HTML 3.2 standard, we respond with a groan,
a bemused smile, or uproarious laughter. Folks, HTML 3.2 doesn't
shake any Web foundations. In fact, the new language standard simply
confirms what most Web observers have known for some time now, that
the browser manufacturers wag the tail of the HTML standards dog.

<p class=para>
Until about mid-1995, people actually were serious about HTML
standards. (Some of us still are.) Until then, standards guided
the development of new browsers. After release of HTML 2.0, however,
the elders of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) responsible for
such language-standards matters lost control. The abortive HTML+
standard never got off the ground, and HTML 3.0 became so bogged
down in debate that the W3C simply shelved the entire draft standard.
HTML 3.0 never happened, despite what some opportunistic marketers
claim in their literature.

<p class=para>
What mired the development of new language standards was Netscape
Navigator. Most Web analysts agree that Netscape's quick
success in becoming the browser of choice for an overwhelming majority
of users can be attributed directly to the company's implementation
of useful and exciting additions to HTML. Today, all other browser
manufacturers--in particular, the behemoth Microsoft Corp.
who appreciates the meaning of "de facto standard"
better than anyone in the business--have to implement Netscape's
HTML extensions if they expect to have any chance of competing in
the web browser marketplace. By pushing the W3C to officially release
HTML standard version 3.2, which for all intents and purposes standardizes
most of Netscape's language extensions, the other browser
manufacturers gain legitimacy for their products without having
to acknowledge the leading competitor. Internet Explorer can now
be "HTML 3.2-compliant," rather than
submissively "Netscape Navigator-compliant."

<p class=para>
The paradox is that the HTML 3.2 standard is <i class=emphasis>not</I>
the definitive resource. There are many more features of the language
in popular use by both Netscape and/or Internet Explorer
than are included in this latest language standard. We promise you,
things can get downright confusing when trying to sort it all out.

<p class=para>
We've managed to sort things out, so you don't
have to sweat over what works with what browser and what doesn't
work. This book, therefore, is the definitive guide to HTML. We
give details for all the elements of the HTML 3.2 standard, plus
the variety of interesting and useful extensions to the language--some
proposed standards--that the popular browser manufacturers
have chosen to include in their products, such as:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Cascading Style Sheets

<p>
<li class=listitem>Java and JavaScript

<p>
<li class=listitem>Frames

<p>
<li class=listitem>Inline multimedia

<p>
<li class=listitem>Layers

<p>
<li class=listitem>Spacers

<p>
<li class=listitem>Text font size and face controls

<p>
<li class=listitem>Multiple columns

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
And while we tell you about each and every feature of the
language, standard or not, we also tell you which browsers or different
versions of the same browser implement a particular extension and
which don't. That's critical knowledge when you
want to create web pages that take advantage of the latest version
of Netscape Navigator versus pages that are accessible to the larger
number of people using Internet Explorer, Mosaic, or even Lynx,
a popular text-only browser for UNIX systems.

<p class=para>
In addition, there are a few things that are closely related
but not directly part of HTML. For example, we touch, but do not
handle CGI and Java programming. CGI and Java programs work closely
with HTML documents and run with or alongside browsers, but are
not part of the language itself, so we don't delve into
them. Besides, they are comprehensive topics that deserve their
own books, such as <i class=citetitle>CGI Programming on the World Wide Web</i>
and <i class=citetitle>Java in a Nutshell</i> from O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, for instance.

<p class=para>
In short, this book is your definitive guide to HTML as it
is and should be used, including every extension we could find.
Many aren't documented anywhere, even in the plethora of
online guides. But, if we've missed anything, certainly
let us know and we'll put it in the next edition.
