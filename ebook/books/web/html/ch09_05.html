<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5">9.5 Applying Styles to Documents</A></h2>

<p class=para>
There are several issues
you should consider before, during, and after you use styles in
your HTML documents and document collections. The first, overarching
issue is whether to use them at all. Frankly, few of the style effects
are unique; most can be achieved, albeit less easily and with much
less consistency, via the physical- and content-based style tags
like <tt>&lt;i&gt;</TT> and <tt>&lt;em&gt;</TT> and the various
tag attributes like color and background.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5.1">To Style or Not to Style</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Effects aside,
the biggest question looming in the minds of HTML developers as
we write this chapter in early 1997 is whether Cascading Style Sheets,
particularly external ones, ever will be fully supported by the
major browsers, or whether some other style-sheet delivery mechanism
will prevail. Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer have
support for Cascading Style Sheets in their most recent versions,
but Microsoft's support is out of date and buggy while
Netscape's is currently incomplete. Moreover, Netscape
has put its development weight behind not CSS, but JavaScript-based
styles (see <a href="ch13_04.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-4">the section called "JavaScript Style Sheets"</A>).

<p class=para>
So, currently, CSS style sheets
are a bittersweet solution; they can create more work than they
are worth. The majority of browsers in use today do not support
styles. That means that to achieve the special effects for most
users, you have to prepare redundant collections--mixed
or separate--containing both styles and style-related tags
and attributes, if you use styles at all. We're right back
in the same boat we were in a year or so ago when deciding whether
to use the many new Netscape extensions to HTML. We believe that
this too will pass: Netscape promises complete support of the entire
CSS standard, and Microsoft surely will update its support to keep
pace with Netscape. While styles may be spotty at best in the first
half of 1997, expect them to be pervasive by the end of the year.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5.2">Which Type of Style Sheet and When</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Once
you have decided to use HTML cascading style sheets (for pain or
pleasure), the next question is which type of style sheet--inline,
document-level, or external--should you apply and when?
Each has its pros and cons; each is best applied under certain circumstances.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5.2.1">The pros and cons of external styles</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Since style sheets ostensibly provide consistency
in the presentation of your documents, external style sheets are
the best and the easiest way to manage styles for your entire document
collection. Simply place the desired style rules in a style sheet
and apply those styles to the desired documents. Since all the documents
are affected by a single style sheet, conversion of the entire collection
to a new style is as simple as changing a single rule in the corresponding
external style sheet.

<p class=para>
Even in cases where documents
may differ in style, it is often possible to collect a few basic
style rules in a single sheet that can be shared among several otherwise
different documents, including:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Background color

<p>
<li class=listitem>Background image

<p>
<li class=listitem>Font sizes and faces

<p>
<li class=listitem>Margins

<p>
<li class=listitem>Text alignment

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Another
benefit of external style sheets is that other web authors who want
to copy your style can easily access that sheet and make their pages
look like yours. Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery,
you should not be troubled when someone elects to emulate the look
and feel of your pages. More to the point, you can't stop
them from linking to your style sheets, so you might as well learn
to like it. Like conventional HTML documents, it is not possible
to encrypt or otherwise hide your style sheets so that others cannot
view and use them.

<p class=para>
The biggest problem with external
style sheets is that they increase the amount of time needed to
access a given web page. Not only must the browser download the
page itself, it must also download the style sheet before the page
can be displayed to the user. While most style sheets are relatively
small, their existence can definitely be felt when accessing the
Web over a slow connection.

<p class=para>
Without appropriate discipline,
external style sheets can become large and unwieldy. When creating
style sheets, remember to include only those styles that are common
to the pages using the sheet. If a set of styles is needed only
for one or two sheets, you are better off isolating them in a separate
sheet or adding them to a document using document-level styles.
Otherwise, you may find yourself expending an exorbitant amount
of effort counteracting the effects of external styles in many individual
documents. 

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5.2.2">The pros and cons of document-level styles</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Document-level
styles are most useful when creating a custom document. They let
you easily override one or more rules in your externally defined
style to create a slightly different document.

<p class=para>
You might
also want to use document-level styles to experiment with new style
rules before moving them to your style sheets. By adding and changing
rules using document-level styles, you eliminate the risk of adding
a broken style to your style sheets, breaking the appearance of
all the documents that use that sheet.

<p class=para>
The biggest problem
with document styles is that you may succumb to using them in lieu
of creating a formal, external style sheet to manage your document
collection. It is easy to simply add rules to each document, cutting
and pasting as you create new documents. Unfortunately, managing
a collection of documents with document-level styles is tedious
and error-prone. Even a simple change can result in hours of editing
and potential mistakes.

<p class=para>
As a rule of thumb, any style
rule that impacts three or more documents should be moved to a style
sheet and applied to those documents using the <tt>&lt;link&gt;</TT>
tag or @import command. Adhering to this rule as you create
your document families will pay off in the long run when it is time
to change your styles.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-9-SECT-5.2.3">The pros and cons of inline styles</A></h4>

<p class=para>
And
at the end of the cascade, inline styles override the more general
styles. Get into the habit now of using inline styles rarely and
just for that purpose, too. Inline styles cannot be reused, making
style management difficult. Moreover, such changes are spread throughout
your documents, making finding and altering inline styles error-prone.
(That's why we might eschew tag- and attribute-based styles
in the first place, no?)

<p class=para>
Anytime you use an inline style,
think long and hard as to whether the same effect might be accomplished
using a style class definition. For instance, you are better off
defining:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--
  P.centered {text-align: center}
  EM.blue {color: blue}
--&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
and later using:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;p class=centered&gt;
&lt;em class=blue&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
instead of:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;em style="color: blue"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Your
styles are easier to find and manage and can be easily reused throughout
your documents.
