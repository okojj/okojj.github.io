<p class=para>
In this day and age of hoopla and hype, <i class=emphasis>how</I> has
become almost as important as <i class=emphasis>what </I>--and in
some cases, more important.  Any successful presentation, even a
thoughtful tome, should have its text organized into an attractive,
effective document. Organizing text into attractive documents is
HTML's forte. The language gives you a number of tools that help you
mold your text and get your message across. HTML also helps structure
your document so your target audience has easy access to your words.

<p class=para>
Always keep in mind while designing your documents (here we go
again!), that HTML tags, particularly in regard to text, only
advise--they do not dictate--how a browser will ultimately
render the document. Rendering varies from browser to browser. Don't
get too entangled with trying to get just the right look and layout.
Your attempts may and probably will be thwarted by the browser.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1">4.1 Divisions and Paragraphs</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Like most text processors, a browser wraps the words it finds in the
HTML text to fit the horizontal width of its viewing window. Widen the
browser's window and words automatically flow up to fill the wider
lines. Squeeze the window and words wrap downwards.

<p class=para>
Unlike most text processors, however, HTML uses explicit division
(<tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT>), paragraph (<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>), and
line-break (<tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT>) tags to control the alignment and
flow of text. Return characters, although quite useful for readability
of the source HTML document, typically are ignored by the
browser--HTML authors must use the <tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT> to
explicitly force a text line break. The <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag,
while also performing the task, carries with it meaning and effects
beyond a simple line break.

<p class=para>
The <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag is a little different. Codified in the
HTML 3.2 standard, <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> was included in the language
to be a simple organizational tool--divide the document into
discrete sections--whose somewhat obtuse meaning meant few
authors used it. But recent browser innovations--the align and
style-related style and class attributes--now let you more
distinctly label and thereby define individual sections of your HTML
documents, as well as control the alignment and appearance of those
sections. These features breathe real life and meaning into the
<tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
By associating a class name with the various sections of your HTML
document, each delimited by a <tt>&lt;div class=name&gt;</TT> tag
and attribute (you can do the same with other tags like
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>, too), you not only label those divisions for
automated processing and management (collect all the bibliography
divisions, for instance), but you may also define different, distinct
display styles for those portions of your document. For instance, you
might define one divisional class for your document's abstract
(<tt>&lt;div class=abstract&gt;</TT>, for example), another for the
body, a third for the conclusion, and a fourth divisional class for
the bibliography (<tt>&lt;div class=biblio&gt;</TT>, for example).

<p class=para>
Each class, then, might be given a different display definition in a
document-level or externally related style sheet: the abstract
indented and in an italic face (div.abstract {left-margin:
+0.5in; font-style: italic}, for example); the body in a
left-justified roman face; the conclusion similar to the abstract; and
the bibliography automatically numbered and formatted appropriately.

<p class=para>
We provide a detailed description of style sheets, classes, and their
applications in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></A>.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.1">The <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As defined in the HTML 3.2 standard, the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag
divides your document into separate, distinct sections. It may be used
strictly as an organizational tool, without any sort of formatting
associated with it; it becomes more effective in this regard if you
add the class attribute to label the division. The
<tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag may also be combined with the align
attribute to control the alignment of whole sections of your
document's content in the display.

<div class=sidebar>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.1.1">The align attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The align attribute for <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> justifies the enclosed
content to either the left (default), center, or right of the browser
display. The <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag may be nested, and the
alignment of the nested <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag takes precedence
over the containing <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag. Further, other nested
alignment tags, such as <tt>&lt;center&gt;</TT>, aligned paragraphs
(see <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> in 4.1.2), or specially aligned table rows
and cells, override the effect of <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.1.2">The nowrap attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Supported only by Internet Explorer, this attribute
suppresses automatic word wrapping of the text within the division.
Line breaks will occur where you have placed carriage returns in
your HTML source document.

<p class=para>
While the nowrap attribute probably doesn't make much sense for large
sections of text that would otherwise be flowed together on the page,
it can make things a bit easier when creating blocks of text with many
explicit line breaks: poetry, for example, or addresses. You don't
have to insert all those explicit <tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tags in a text
flow within a <tt>&lt;div nowrap&gt;</TT> tag. On the other hand,
all other browsers ignore the nowrap attribute and merrily flow your
text together anyway. If you are targeting only Internet Explorer with
your documents, consider using nowrap where needed, but otherwise, we
can't recommend this attribute for general use.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.1.3">The lang attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The lang attribute lets you specify the language used within the
division. The value of the attribute is any of the ISO standard
two-character language abbreviations. For example, adding lang=en
tells the browser that the division is written in English. Presumably,
the browser may make layout or typographic decisions based upon your
language choice.

<p class=para>
This attribute is only supported by Internet Explorer; all other
browsers ignore it. Even within Internet Explorer, there are no
behaviors defined for any specific language.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.1.4">The style and class attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Use the style attribute with the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag to create
an inline style for the content enclosed by the tag. The class
attribute lets you apply the style of a predefined class of the
<tt>&lt;div&gt;</TT> tag to the contents of this division. The value
of the class attribute is the name of a style defined in some
document-level or externally defined style sheet. In addition,
class-identified divisions also lend themselves well for computer
processing of your documents, such as extraction of all divisions
whose class name is "biblio," for example, for the automated assembly
of a master bibliography. [<a href="ch09_01.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-1.1">the section called "Inline Styles: The style Attribute"</A>] [<a href="ch09_02.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4">the section called "Style Classes"</A>]

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2">The <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag signals the start of a paragraph. That's
not well known even by some veteran webmasters because it runs
counterintuitive to what we've come to expect from experience. Most
word processors we're familiar with use just one special character,
typically the return character, to signal the <i class=emphasis>end</I>
of a paragraph.

<div class=sidebar>
<p class=sidebar><blockquote><tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>

<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>Function:<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Used in:<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>block</I></DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the recommended HTML way, each paragraph starts with
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> and ends with the corresponding
<tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> tag. And while a sequence of newline characters
in a text processor-displayed document creates an empty paragraph for
each one, HTML browsers typically ignore all but the first paragraph
tag.

<p class=para>
In practice, you also can ignore the starting <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag
at the beginning of the first paragraph, as well as the
<tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> tag at the end of all paragraphs, since they can
be implied from other tags that occur in the document, and hence
safely omitted. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
This is the first paragraph, at the very beginning of the 
body of this document.
&lt;p&gt;
The tag above signals the start of this second paragraph. 
When rendered by a browser, it will begin slightly below the 
end of the first paragraph, with a bit of extra whitespace 
between the two paragraphs.
&lt;p&gt;
This is the last paragraph in the example.
&lt;/body&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice that we haven't included the paragraph start tag
(<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>) for the first paragraph or any end paragraph
tags at all in the example; they can be unambiguously inferred by the
browser and are therefore unnecessary.

<p class=para>
In general, you'll find that human document authors tend to omit
postulated tags whenever possible, while automatic document generators
tend to insert them. That may be because the software designers didn't
want to run the risk of having their product chided by competitors as
not adhering to the HTML standard, even though we're splitting
letter-of-the-law hairs here. Go ahead and be defiant: omit that first
paragraph's <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag and don't give a second thought
to paragraph ending <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> tags, provided, of course,
that your document's structure and clarity are not compromised.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2.1">Paragraph rendering</A></h4>

<p class=para>
When encountering a new paragraph (<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>) tag, a
browser typically inserts one blank line plus some extra vertical
space into the document before starting the new paragraph. The browser
then collects all the words and, if present, inline images into the
new paragraph, ignoring leading and trailing spaces (not spaces
between words, of course) and return characters in the HTML text. The
browser software then flows the resulting sequence of words and images
into a paragraph that fits within the margins of its display window,
automatically generating line breaks as needed to wrap the text within
the window.  For example, compare how a browser arranges the text into
lines and paragraphs (<a href="#HTML-CH-4-FIG-1">Figure 4.1</A>) to how the
preceding HTML example is printed on the page. The browser may also
automatically hyphenate long words, and the paragraph may be
full-justified to stretch the line of words out towards both margins.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-FIG-1">Figure 4.1: Browsers ignore common return characters in the source HTML document</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0401.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 4-1]" width=500 height=245 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
The net result is that you do not have to worry about line length,
word wrap, and line breaks when composing your HTML documents. The
browser will take any arbitrary sequence of words and images and
display a nicely formatted paragraph.

<p class=para>
If you want to control line length and breaks explicitly, consider
using a preformatted text block with the <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</TT>
tag. If you need to force a line break, use the <tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT>
tag. [&lt;pre&gt;: <a href="ch04_07.html#HTML-CH-4-SECT-7.5">the section called "The <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]
[&lt;br&gt;: <a href="ch04_07.html#HTML-CH-4-SECT-7.1">the section called "The <tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2.2">The align attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Most browsers automatically left-justify a new paragraph. To change
this behavior, HTML 3.2 gives you the align attribute for the
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag and provides three kinds of content
justification: left, right, or center.

<p class=para>
<a href="#HTML-CH-4-FIG-2">Figure 4.2</A> shows you the effect of each
alignment, as rendered from the following source:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;p align=right&gt;
Right over here!
&lt;br&gt;
This is too. 
&lt;p align=left&gt;
Slide back left. 
&lt;p align=center&gt;
Smack in the middle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
Left's the default.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-FIG-2">Figure 4.2: Effect of the align attribute on paragraph justification (Netscape 2.0)</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_0402.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 4-2]" width=500 height=245 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice in the example that the paragraph alignment remains in effect
until the browser encounters another <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag or an
ending <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> tag (we deliberately left out a final
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag in the example to illustrate the effects of
the <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> end tag on paragraph justification). Other
body elements may also disrupt the current paragraph alignment and
cause subsequent paragraphs to revert to the default left alignment,
including forms, headers, tables, and most other body content-related
tags.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2.3">The style and class attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Use the style attribute with the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag to create an
inline style for the paragraph's contents. The class attribute lets
you label the paragraph with a name that refers to a predefined class
of the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag declared in some document-level or
externally defined style sheet. And, class-identified paragraphs lend
themselves well for computer processing of your documents, such as
extraction of all paragraphs whose class name is "citation," for
example, for automated assembly of a master list of citations.  [<a href="ch09_01.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-1.1">the section called "Inline Styles: The style Attribute"</A>] [<a href="ch09_02.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4">the section called "Style Classes"</A>]

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2.4">Allowed paragraph content</A></h4>

<p class=para>
An HTML paragraph may contain any element allowed in a text flow,
including conventional words and punctuation, links (&lt;a&gt;),
images (&lt;img&gt;), line breaks (&lt;br&gt;), font changes
(&lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, &lt;strike&gt;,
&lt;big&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, and
&lt;font&gt;), and content-based style changes (&lt;cite&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;, &lt;dfn&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;kbd&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;var&gt;).  If any other element occurs within
the paragraph, it implies the paragraph has ended, and the browser
assumes the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag was not specified.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-4-SECT-1.2.5">Allowed paragraph usage</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You may specify a paragraph only within a <i class=emphasis>block</I>,
along with other paragraphs, lists, forms, and preformatted text. In
general, this means that paragraphs can appear where a flow of text is
appropriate, such as in the body of a document, an element in a list,
and so on. Technically, paragraphs cannot appear within a header,
anchor, or other element whose content is strictly text-only. In
practice, most browsers ignore this restriction and format the
paragraph as a part of the containing element.
