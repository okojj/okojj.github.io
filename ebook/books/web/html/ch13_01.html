<p class=para>
Truth be told, pure HTML is like a comic book in a world full
of Saturday morning cartoons. Save for the occasional animated GIF
image, a pure HTML page, although attractive, is a static presentation
of text and images. HTML documents need not be limited like the
print medium. The Web is a digital dynamo of animation and processing
activity, spread over the worldwide Internet. And, with recent innovations,
HTML can shimmy, too.

<p class=para>
To spice up those otherwise dull pages, a number of HTML tags
exist solely to inject dynamic content into your pages. Commonly
known as an applet or script, and embedded into the HTML document,
these programs get delivered to your browser and executed in any
of several different ways. During execution, the applets and scripts
may generate dynamic HTML content, interact with the user, validate
form data, or even create windows and run entire applications independent
of your HTML pages. The possibilities are endless, and go far beyond
the document model originally envisioned for HTML.

<p class=para>
In this chapter, we describe how dynamic content can augment
your HTML documents. We'll show you, with simple examples,
how to embed and include executable content--scripts and
applets--in your HTML documents. We won't, however,
even begin to pretend to teach you how to write and debug your own
applet programs. This is a book about HTML, after all. Rather, get
an expert opinion: turn to any of the many excellent texts from
O'Reilly, including JavaScript: The Definitive
Guide, Java in a Nutshell, and Exploring Java.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1">13.1 Applets</A></h2>

<p class=para>
One of the most exciting
recent developments in web technologies is the ability to deliver
applications directly to the user's browser, where they
are executed on the client machine. These applications are typically
small tools--hence the term "applet"--that
perform simple tasks on the client computer, including a variety
of HTML page display enhancements.

<p class=para>
Applets, like client-side image maps, represent a shift in
the basic model of web communications. Until recently, servers performed
most of the computational work on the Web; client browsers being
not much more than glorified terminals. With applets and client-side
image maps, Web technology is shifting toward the client, distributing
some or all of the computational load from the server to the client
and browser.

<p class=para>
Applets also represent a way of extending a browser's
features without forcing users to purchase or otherwise acquire
a new browser, as is the case when developers implement new tag
and attribute extensions to HTML. Nor do users have to acquire and
install a special application, as is required for helper or plugin
applications. This means that once users have a browser that supports
applets, you can deliver browser extensions immediately, including
HTML display and multimedia innovations.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.1">The Applet Model</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Applets are like other accessory parts of an HTML document.
The browser first loads the HTML page, examines it for special tags
that identify applets, which, like other Web resources you identified
with a URL, and retrieves the applet via the normal HTTP protocol.

<p class=para>
Once downloaded, the browser provides a portion of the document
display space for the applet to use as its own display space. You
may control the size and position of this display area; the applet
controls what is presented inside.

<p class=para>
During execution, the applet has access to a restricted environment
within the user's computer. For instance, applets have
access to the mouse and keyboard, and may receive input from the
user. They can initiate network connections and retrieve data from
other servers on the Internet. In sum, applets are full-fledged
programs, complete with a variety of input and output mechanisms,
along with a full suite of network services.

<p class=para>
Several applets may be placed in a single document; they all
execute in parallel and may communicate with each other. While the
browser may limit their access to its computer system, applets have
complete control of their virtual environment within the browser.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.2">The Applet Advantage</A></h3>

<p class=para>
There are several advantages of applets, not the least of
which is providing more compelling user interfaces within a web
page. For instance, an applet might create a unique set of menus,
choices, text fields, and similar user-input tools different from
those available through the browser. When the user clicks a button
within the applet's interaction/display region,
the applet might respond by displaying results within the region,
signaling another applet, or even by loading a completely new page
into the browser.

<p class=para>
We don't mean to imply that the only use of applets
is to enhance the user interface. An applet is a full-fledged program
that can perform any number of computational and user-interactive
tasks on the client computer. An applet might implement a real-time
video display, or perform circuit simulation, or engage the user
in a game, and so on.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.3">Using Applets Correctly</A></h3>

<p class=para>
An applet is nothing more than another tool you may use to
produce compelling and useful web pages. Keep in mind that an applet
uses computational resources on the client to run and therefore
places a load on the user's computer. It can degrade system

performance.

<p class=para>
Similarly, if an applet uses a lot of network bandwidth to
accomplish its task (a real-time video feed, for example), it may
make other network communication unbearably slow. While such applications
are fun, they do little more than annoy your target audience.

<p class=para>
To use an applet correctly, balance the load between the browser
and the server. For each page, decide which tasks are best left
to the server (forms processing, index searches, and the like) and
which tasks are better suited for local processing (user interface
enhancements, real-time data presentation, small animations, input
validation, and so on). Divide the processing accordingly. Remember
that many users have slower network connections and computers than
you do and design your applets to satisfy the majority of your audience.

<p class=para>
Used the right way, applets seamlessly enhance your pages
and provide a satisfying experience for your audience. Used improperly,
applets are just another annoying bandwidth waster, alienating your
users and hurting your pages.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.4">Writing Applets</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Creating applets is
a programming task, not usually a job for the HTML author, and certainly
way beyond the scope of this book. For details, we recommend you
consult any of the many applet programming texts that have recently
appeared on bookshelves everywhere, including those from O'Reilly
&amp; Associates.

<p class=para>
Today, one language dominates the applet programming world:

Java. Developed by Sun Microsystems of
Mountain View, California, Java supports an object-oriented programming
style wherein classes of applets can be used and reused to build
complex applications.

<p class=para>
By invention, applets built from the same language should
run with any browser that supports them. In reality, certain Microsoft
implementation decisions have caused some valid Java applets to
fail when running on Internet Explorer. Hopefully, Microsoft will
fix these problems and Java will remain a universal programming
language for the Web. In any case, the conscientious Java programmer
should keep abreast of the latest technology and create applets
that are certifiably 100% pure Java. Microsoft, in particular,
is trying to get programmers to use proprietary extensions to Java
that will work on only Microsoft platforms. We recommend avoiding
any vendor extensions to Java that deviate from the standard Java
1.1 version currently in widespread use.

<p class=para>
We should take this opportunity to also mention 
ActiveX, an alternative applet programming
technology available only from Microsoft. ActiveX is proprietary,
closely coupled to various versions of Microsoft Windows, and is
only fully functional when used with 
Internet Explorer. ActiveX applets will
run on versions of Internet Explorer targeted to various versions
of Windows, but a single ActiveX applet will not run on these different
versions without recompilation. This is in contrast with Java applets,
where a single Java applet can be written and compiled once and
immediately run on a broad range of browsers and operating systems.

<p class=para>
ActiveX also presents an unacceptably high 
security risk to any user whose browser supports
ActiveX technology. It is ridiculously easy to penetrate and damage
a computer running a browser that allows ActiveX applets to be executed.
For this reason, we cannot recommend ActiveX as a viable applet
implementation technology and we go so far as to recommend that
users disable ActiveX capability within their browser--specifically,
Internet Explorer.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5">The <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Use the 
<tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag within your HTML document to name the applet that the browser
should download and execute. Also, use the tag to define a region
within the document display for the applet's display area.
You may also supply alternative content within the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag for display by browsers that do not support applets.

<div class=sidebar>

</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Code is the only required attribute. It identifies the class
name of the Java program.

<p class=para>
The browser inserts the applet display region into the containing
text flow exactly like an inline image: without line breaks and
as a single large entity. The browser downloads and executes the
applet just after download and display of the HTML document, and
continues execution until the code terminates itself or when the
user stops viewing the page containing the applet.

<p class=para>
Most applets require one or more parameters that you supply
in the HTML document to control their execution. Put these parameters
between the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag and its corresponding
<tt>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> end tag using the <tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT>
tag. The browser passes the document-specific parameters to the
applet at time of execution. [<a href="#HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.6">the section called "The <tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT> Tag"</A>]

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.1">The align attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Like an image,
you may control the alignment of an applet's display region
with respect to its surrounding text. In fact, the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag's align attribute honors all the alignment values used
by the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag, including top, texttop, middle,
absmiddle, baseline, bottom, and absbottom, as well as left and
right alignments for wrap-around content. [<a href="ch05_02.html#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.4">the section called "The align attribute"</A>]

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.2">The alt attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
alt attribute
gives you a way to tell users gracefully that something is missing
if, for some reason, the applet cannot or will not execute on their
computer. Its value is a quote-enclosed message string that, like
the alt attribute for images, gets displayed in lieu of the applet
itself.

<p class=para>
The alt message is only for browsers that support applets.
See 13.1.5.11 to find out how to inform users of applet-incapable
browsers why they can't view an applet.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.3">The archive attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Supported
only by Netscape, the archive attribute lets you collect common
Java classes into a single library that is cached on the user's
local disk. Once cached, the browser doesn't need to use
the network to access an applet; it retrieves the software from
the local cache, thereby reducing the inherent delays of additional
network activity to load the class.

<p class=para>
The value of the archive attribute is a URL identifying the
archive file. The suffix of the archive filename may be either <i class=emphasis>.zip</I>
or <i class=emphasis>.jar</I>. <i class=emphasis>.zip</I> files are
in the familiar ZIP archive format, generated by PKZIP and many
other utilities. <i class=emphasis>.jar</I> files are in the new
Java archive format; currently, support for <i class=emphasis>.jar</I>
files is spotty at best, but they will become more widespread. <i class=emphasis>.jar</I>
files support compression and some advanced features like digital
signatures.

<p class=para>
You may use the archive attribute with any <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag, even if the class referenced by the tag's code attribute
does not exist in the archive. If the class is not found in the
archive, the browser simply attempts to retrieve the class relative
to the document URL or the codebase URL, if specified.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.4">The code attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
code
attribute is required. Use it to specify the filename of the Java
class to be executed by the browser. Note that this is not a URL;
the browser assumes the applet file is in the same directory as
the host HTML document. To make the search relative to another storage
location, use the codebase attribute described in 13.1.5.5 or an
archive, as described above. Also, the extension suffix of the filename
should be <i class=emphasis>.class</I>. If you don't include
the suffix, some browsers automatically will append <i class=emphasis>.class</I>
when searching for the applet.

<p class=para>
For example, to execute a clock Java applet contained in a
file named <i class=filename>clock.class</i>, you might include in
your HTML document the code:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The browser will locate the code for the applet using the
current document's base URL. Hence, if the current document's
URL is:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/harvest_time.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
the browser will retrieve the applet code for our clock class
example above as:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/clock.class
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.5">The codebase attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Use the 
codebase
attribute to provide an alternative base URL from which the browser
will retrieve an applet file. The value of this attribute is a URL
pointing to a directory containing the class defined by the code
attribute. The codebase URL overrides, but does not permanently
replace, the document's base URL, which is the default
if you don't use codebase. [<a href="ch07_02.html#HTML-CH-7-SECT-2">the section called "Referencing Documents: The URL"</A>]

<p class=para>
Continuing with our previous examples, suppose your document
came from <i class=emphasis>http://www.kumquat.com</I>, but the clock
applet is kept in a separate directory named classes. You cannot
retrieve the applet by specifying code=classes/clock.class.
Rather, include the codebase attribute and new base URL:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class codebase="http://www.kumquat.com/classes/"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
which resolves to the URL:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://www.kumquat.com/classes/clock.class
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Although we used an absolute URL in this example, you also
can use a relative URL. For instance, in most cases the applets
are stored on the same server as the host HTML documents, so we'd
usually be better off, for relocation's sake, specifying
a relative URL for the codebase, such as:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class codebase="/classes/"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.6">The name attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
name attribute
lets you supply a unique name for this instance of the code class--the
copy of the applet that runs on the individual user's computer.
Like other named elements in your HTML document, providing a name
for the applet lets other parts of your HTML document, including
other applets, reference and interact with this one, such as sharing
computed results.

<p class=para>
For example, suppose you have two clock applets in your document,
along with two applets the user operates to set those clocks. Provide
unique names for the clock applets using the name attribute, then
pass those names to the setting applets using the <tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT>
tag, which we discuss later in this chapter:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class name=clock1&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;applet code=clock.class name=clock2&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;applet code=setter.class&gt;
  &lt;param name=clockToSet value=clock1&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;applet code=setter.class&gt;
  &lt;param name=clockToSet value=clock2&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Since we have no need to distinguish between the Setter applets,
we choose not to name their instances.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.7">The height and width attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Identical
to the counterparts for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag, the height
and width attributes define the size of the applet's display
region in the document. They both accept values indicating the size
of the region in pixels. [<a href="ch05_02.html#HTML-CH-5-SECT-2.6.9">the section called "The height and width attributes"</A>]

<p class=para>
The display region's dimensions often must match
some other applet requirement, so be careful to check these values
with the applet programmer. Sometimes, the applet may scale its
display output to match your specified region.

<p class=para>
For example, suppose our example clock applet should grow
or shrink to fit nearly any size display region. Hence, we might
create a square clock 100 pixels wide by 100 pixels tall:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class height=100 width=100&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.8">The hspace and vspace attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
As with a floating or inline image,
surrounding text tightly abuts an applet's display region.
The hspace and vspace attributes let you interpose some empty space
around the applet region to set it off from the text. Both attributes
accept a value that indicates pixels of space, with the hspace attribute
creating a space to the left and right of the region; the vspace
attribute adds space above and below the region.

<p class=para>
For instance, to give our example clock some breathing room
on the page, we might place an additional five pixels of space around
it:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class height=100 width=100 hspace=5 vspace=5&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.9">The mayscript attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
mayscript
attribute, supported only by Netscape, indicates that the Java applet
will be accessing JavaScript features within the browser. Normally,
Java applets attempting to access JavaScript cause a browser error.
If your applets access JavaScript, you must specify mayscript in
the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.10">The title attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The value of this 
attribute
is a quoted string, which is used by Internet Explorer to provide
a title, if necessary, for the applet. This attribute is not supported
by Netscape.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.5.11">Supporting incompatible browsers</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Since some browsers may not
support applets or the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag, sometimes
you may need to tell readers what they are missing. You do this
by including HTML body content between the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
and <tt>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> tags.

<p class=para>
Browsers that support the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tags
ignore the HTML content inside. (Use the alt attribute to notify
applet-enabled browser users when the applet doesn't display
for some reason.) Of course, browsers that don't support
applets don't recognize the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tags. Being generally tolerant of apparent HTML mistakes, they will
usually ignore the unrecognized tag and blithely go on to display
whatever content may appear inside. It's as simple as that.
The following fragment tells applet-incapable browser users they
won't see our clock example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class&gt;
  If your browser were capable of handling applets, you'd see
  a nifty clock right here!
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Remember that this contained text is different from the text
supplied by the 
alt
attribute of the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag. The alt text is
displayed by browsers that support the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag but cannot execute or display the specified applet. The contained
text is displayed by browsers that do not support the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag at all. In order to accommodate both classes of browsers, the
considerate author supplies both for each <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>
tag:

<p class=para>
<tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clockclass height=100 width=100
  alt="[ Clock applet not available ]"&gt;
  &lt;param name=style value=analog&gt;
  If your browser were capable of handling applets, you'd see
  a nifty analog clock right here!

<p class=para>
The
<tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag has two required attributes: name
and value. Both attributes accept strings as their value and together
define a name/value pair that the browser passes to the
applet.

<p class=para>
For instance, our Clock applet example might let users specify
the time zone by which it sets its hour hand. To pass the parameter
named "timezone" with the value "EST"
to our example applet, you would specify the parameters as:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=clock.class&gt;
  &lt;param name=timezone value=EST&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Since both attributes had simple strings for values, we did
not enclose the values in quotation marks. For values with embedded
punctuation and spaces, be sure to delimit the strings accordingly.

<p class=para>
The browser will pass the name/value pairs to the
applet, but that is no guarantee that the applet is expecting the
parameters, that the names and values are correct, or that the applet
will even use the parameters. Correct parameter names, including
capitalization, and acceptable values are determined by the applet
author. The wise HTML document author will work closely with the
applet author or have detailed documentation to ensure that the
applet parameters are named correctly and assigned valid values.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-13-SECT-1.6.2">The type and valuetype attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
type and valuetype attributes are supported
only by Internet Explorer. Use them to define the type of the parameter
the browser passes to the embedded object and how that object is
to interpret the value. Used only with <tt>&lt;param&gt;</TT>
tags contained within an <tt>&lt;object&gt;</TT> tag (see 13.2),
these attributes have no use with parameters being passed to Java
applets.

<p class=para>
The valuetype attribute can have one of three values: data,
ref, or object. The value data indicates that the parameter value
is a simple string. This is the default value. Using ref indicates
that the value is a URL of some other resource on the web. Finally,
object indicates that the value is the name of another embedded
object in the current document. This may be needed to support inter-object
communication within an HTML document.

<p class=para>
The value of the type attribute is the MIME media type of
the value of the parameter. This is usually of no significance when
the parameter value is a simple string, but can be important when
the value is actually a URL pointing to some other object on the
Web. In those cases, the embedded object may need to know the MIME
type of the object in order to use it correctly. For example, this
parameter tells the embedded object that the parameter is actually
the URL of a Microsoft Word document
