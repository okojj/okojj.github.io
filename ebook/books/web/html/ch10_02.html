<p class=para>
Use the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag to define any one of a number of
common form elements, including text fields, multiple-choice lists,
clickable images, and submission buttons. Although there are many
attributes for this tag, only the type and name attributes are
required for each element (only type for a submission or reset button;
see following explanation), and as we describe in detail later, each
type of input element uses only a subset of the allowed
attributes. Additional <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> attributes may be
required based upon which type of form element you
specify. <a href="#HTML-CH-10-TAB-1">Table 10.1</A> summarizes the various form
<tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> types and attributes, required and optional.

<p class=para>
You select the type of element to include
in the form with the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag's required
type attribute, and you name the field (used during the form-submission
process to the server; see above) with the name attribute. Although
the value of the name attribute is technically an arbitrary string,
we recommend you use a name without embedded spaces or punctuation.
If you stick to just letters and numbers (but no leading digits)
and represent spaces with the underscore (_) character,
you'll have fewer problems. For example, "cost_in_dollars"
and "overhead_percentage" are good choices
for element names; "$cost" and "overhead
%" might cause problems.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.2">Text Fields in Forms</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The HTML standard lets you include three types
of text entry fields in your forms: a conventional text entry field,
a masked field for secure data entry, and a field that names a file
to be transmitted as part of your form data. The first two are available
with all browsers and accept size, maxlength, and value attributes.
The file-selection field accepts only the size and maxlength attributes.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.2.1">Conventional text fields</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The most useful
as well as the most common form input element is the text entry
field. A text entry field appears in the browser window as an empty
box on one line and accepts a single line of user input that becomes
the value of the element when the user submits the form to the server.
To create a text entry field inside a form in your HTML document,
set the type of the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> form element to text.
Include a name attribute as well; it's required.

<p class=para>
What constitutes a line of text differs among
the various browsers. Fortunately, HTML gives us a way, with 
size
and maxlength attributes, to dictate the width, in characters, of
the text input display box, and how many total characters to accept
from the user, respectively. The value for either attribute is an
integer equal to the maximum number of characters you'll
allow the user to see and type in the field. If maxlength exceeds
size, then text scrolls back and forth within the text entry box.
If maxlength is smaller than size, there will be extra blank space
in the text entry box to make up the difference between the two
attributes.

<p class=para>
The default value for size is dependent
upon the browser; the default value for maxlength is unlimited.
We recommend you set them yourself. Adjust the size attribute so
that the text entry box does not extend beyond the right margin
of a typical browser window (about 60 characters with a very short
prompt). Set maxlength to a reasonable number of characters; for
example, 2 for state abbreviations, 12 for phone numbers, and so
on.

<p class=para>
A text entry field is usually blank at first until
the user types something into it. You may, however, specify an initial
default value for the field with the value attribute. The user may
modify the default, of course. If the user presses a form's
reset button, the value of the field is reset to this default value.
[<a href="#HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.2">the section called "Reset buttons"</A>]

<p class=para>
These are all valid text entry fields:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=text name=comments&gt;
&lt;input type=text name=zipcode size=10 maxlength=10&gt;
&lt;input type=text name=address size=30 maxlength=256&gt;
&lt;input type=text name=rate size=3 maxlength=3 value="100"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first example
creates a text entry field set to the browser's default
width and maximum length. As we argue above, this is not a good
idea because defaults vary widely among browsers, and your form
layout is sure to look bad with some of them. Rather, fix the width
and maximum number of acceptable input characters as we do in the
second example: it lets the user type in up to ten characters inside
an input box ten characters wide. Its value will be sent to the
server with the name "zipcode" when the user submits
the form.

<p class=para>
The third example field tells the browser
to display a 30-character-wide text input box into which the user
may type up to 256 characters. The browser automatically scrolls
text inside the input box to expose the extra characters.

<p class=para>
The
last text input field is three characters wide, lets the user type
in only three characters, and sets its initial value to 100.

<p class=para>
Notice in the second and fourth example fields, it is implied
that certain kinds of data are to be entered by the user--a
postal code or a numeric rate, respectively. Except for limiting
<i class=emphasis>how many</I>, HTML provides no way for you to dictate
<i class=emphasis>what</I> characters may be typed into a text input
field. For instance, in the last example field, the user may type
"ABC" even though you intend it to be a number
less than 1,000. Your server-side application must trap erroneous
or mistaken input, as well as check for incomplete forms, and send
the appropriate error message to the user when things aren't
right. That can be a tedious process, so we emphasize again, provide
clear and precise instructions and prompts. Make sure your forms
tell users what kinds of input you expect from them, thereby reducing
the number of mistakes they may make when filling it out.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.2.2">Masked text fields</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Like the Lone Ranger,
the mask is on the good guys in a masked text field. It behaves
just like a conventional text field in a form, except that the user-typed
characters don't appear onscreen. Rather, the browser obscures
the characters in a masked text to keep such things as passwords
and other sensitive codes from prying eyes.

<p class=para>
To create
a masked text field, set the value of the type attribute to password.
All other attributes and semantics of the conventional text field
apply to the masked field. Hence, you must provide a name, and you
may (we recommend it) specify a size and maxlength for the field,
as well as an initial value.

<p class=para>
Don't be misled:
a masked text field is not all that secure. The typed-in value is
only obscured onscreen; the browser transmits it unencrypted when
the form is submitted to the server. So, while prying eyes may not
see them onscreen, devious bad guys may steal the information electronically.

<p class=para>
file selection fields

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.2.3">File selection fields</A></h4>

<p class=para>
As its name implies, the field lets users
select a file stored on their computer and send it to the server
when they submit the form. Although part of the HTML 3.2 standard
and documented by Microsoft as being supported, file-selection fields
do not work in Internet Explorer 3.0. They do work in Netscape.

<p class=para>
The browser presents the file-selection form field to the
user like other text fields. With Netscape, it's accompanied
by a button labeled "Browse" to its right. Users
either type the pathname directly as text into the field or, with
the Browse option, select the name of a locally stored file from
a system-specific dialog box.

<p class=para>
Create a file-selection
field in a form by setting the value of the type attribute to file.
Like other text fields, the size and maxlength of a file-selection
field should be set to appropriate values, with the browser creating
a field 20 characters wide, if not otherwise directed. Since file
and directory names differ widely among systems, it makes no sense
to provide a default value for this field. As such, the value attribute
should not be used with this kind of text field.

<p class=para>
The
Browse button associated with Netscape's file-selection
field opens a platform-specific file-selection dialog that allows
users to select a value for the field. In this case, the entire
pathname of the selected file is placed into the field, even if
the length of that pathname exceeds the field's specified
maxlength.

<p class=para>
Use the 
accept attribute
to constrain the types of files that the browser lets the user select.
It's value is a comma-separated list of MIME encodings;
users can only select files whose type matches one of those in the
list. For example, to restrict the selection to images, you might
add accept="image/*" to the file selection
<tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
Unlike other form input
elements, the file-selection field only works correctly with a specific
form data encoding and transmission method. If you include one or
more file-selection fields in your form, you must set the 
enctype
attribute of the <tt>&lt;form&gt;</TT> tag to multipart/form-data
and the <tt>&lt;form&gt;</TT> tag's method attribute
to post. Otherwise, the file-selection field behaves like a regular
text field, transmitting its value (that is, the file's
pathname) to the server instead of the contents of the file itself.

<p class=para>
This is all easier than it may sound. For example,
here is a form that collects a person's name and favorite
file:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;form enctype="multipart/form-data" method=post
    action="cgi-bin/save_file"&gt;
Your name: &lt;input type=text size=20 name=the_name&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your favorite file: &lt;input type=file size=20 name=fav_file&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The data transmitted from the browser to the server for this
example form has two parts. The first contains the value for the
name field, and the second contains the name and contents of the
specified file:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
-----------------------------6099238414674
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="the_name"
  
One line of text field contents
-----------------------------6099238414674
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fav_file"; filename="abc"
  
First line of file
...
Last line of file
-----------------------------6099238414674--
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The browsers don't check that a valid file has been
specified by the user. If no file is specified, the filename portion
of the Content-Disposition header will be empty. If the file doesn't
exist, its name appears in the filename subheader, but there will
be no Content-Type header or subsequent lines of file content. Valid
files may contain nonprintable or binary data; there is no way to
restrict user-selectable file types. In light of these potential
problems, the form-processing application on the server should be
robust enough to handle missing files, erroneous files, extremely
large files, and files with unusual or unexpected formats.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.3">Checkboxes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The
checkbox element gives users a way to quickly and easily select
or deselect an item in your form. Checkboxes may also be grouped
to create a set of choices, any of which may be selected or deselected
by the user.

<p class=para>
Create individual checkboxes by setting
the type attribute for each <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag to checkbox.
Include the required name and value attributes. If the item is selected,
it will contribute a value when the form is submitted. If it is
not selected, that element will not contribute a value. The optional
checked attribute (no value) tells the browser to display a checked
checkbox and include the value when submitting the form to the server
unless the user specifically clicks the mouse to deselect (uncheck)
the box.

<p class=para>
The browsers include the value of selected
(checked) checkboxes with other form parameters when they are submitted
to the server. The value of the checked checkbox is the text string
you specify in the required value attribute. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  What pets do you own?
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;input type=checkbox name=pets value="dog"&gt; Dog
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=checkbox checked name=pets value="cat"&gt; Cat
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=checkbox name=pets value="bird"&gt; Bird
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=checkbox name=pets value="fish"&gt; Fish
&lt;/form&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
creates a checkbox group as shown in <a href="#HTML-CH-10-FIG-3">Figure 10.3</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-FIG-3">Figure 10.3: A checkbox group</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_1003.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 10-3]" width=500 height=202 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Although part of the group, each checkbox
element appears as a separate choice onscreen. Notice too, with
all due respect to dog, bird, and fish lovers, that we've
preselected the cat checkbox with the checked attribute in its tag.
We've also provided text labels; the similar value attributes
don't appear in the browser's window, but are
the values included in the form's parameter list if the
checkbox is selected and the form is submitted to the server by
the user. Also, you need to use paragraph or line-break tags to
control the layout of your checkbox group, as you do for other form
elements.

<p class=para>
In the example, if "Cat"
and "Fish" are checked when the form is submitted,
the values included in the parameter list sent to the server would
be:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
pets=cat
pets=fish
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.4">Radio Buttons</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Radio-button form elements are similar in behavior
to checkboxes, except that only one in the group may be selected
by the user.[3]
Create a radio button by setting the type attribute of the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
element to radio. Like checkbox elements, radio buttons each require
a name and value attribute. Radio buttons with the same name are
members of a group. One of them may be initially checked by including
the checked attribute with that element. If no element in the group
is checked, the browser automatically checks the first element in
the group.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
Some of us are old enough, while not
yet senile, to recall when automobile radios had mechanical pushbuttons
for selecting a station. Pushing in one button popped out the previously
depressed one, implementing a mechanical one-of-many choice mechanism.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
You should give each radio button element
a different value, so the server can sort them out after submission
of the form.

<p class=para>
Here's the previous example reworked
so that now you get to choose only one animal as a favorite pet
(see <a href="#HTML-CH-10-FIG-4">Figure 10.4</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  Which type of animal is your favorite pet?
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;input type=radio name=favorite value="dog"&gt; Dog
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=radio checked name=favorite value="cat"&gt; Cat
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=radio name=favorite value="bird"&gt; Bird
  &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=radio name=favorite value="fish"&gt; Fish
&lt;/form&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-FIG-4">Figure 10.4: Radio buttons allow only one selection per group</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/h2_1004.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 10-4]" width=500 height=199 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Again, like the previous example with checkboxes,
we've tipped our hat toward felines, making the "Cat"
radio button the default choice. If you select an alternative--"Bird,"
for instance--the browser automatically deselects "Cat."
When the form is submitted to the server, the browser includes only
one value with the name "favorite" in the list
of form parameters; favorite=bird, if that was your choice.

<p class=para>
Since one of the elements in a group of radio buttons
is always selected, it makes no sense to create a single radio button;
they should appear in your documents as groups of two or more. (Use
checkboxes for on/off, yes/no types of form elements.)

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5">Action Buttons</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Although the terminology
is potentially confusing, there is another class of buttons for
HTML forms. Unlike the radio buttons and checkboxes described above,
these special types of <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> form elements act
immediately, their effects cannot be reversed, and they affect the
entire contents of the form, not just the value of a single field.
These "action" buttons (for lack of a better term)
include submit, reset, regular, and clickable image buttons. When
selected by the user, both the submit and image buttons cause the
browser to submit all of the form's parameters to the form-processing
server. A regular button does not submit the form, but can be used
to invoke JavaScript code to manipulate or validate the form. The
reset button acts locally to return a partially filled-out form
to its original (default) state. [<a href="ch13_03.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-3.3">the section called "JavaScript Event Handlers"</A>]

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.1">Submission buttons</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
submit button (<tt>&lt;input type=submit&gt;</TT>)
does what its name implies, setting in motion the form's
submission to the server from the browser. You may have more than
one submit button in a form. You may also include name and value
attributes with the submit type of input form button.

<p class=para>
With the simplest submit button (that without a name or value
attribute), the browser displays a small rectangle or oval with the
default label "Submit" (see <a href="ch10_01.html#HTML-CH-10-FIG-1">Figure 10.1</A>).
Otherwise, the browser will label the button with the text you include
with the tag's value attribute. If you provide a name attribute, the
value attribute for the submit button will be added to the parameter
list the browser sends along to the server. That's good, because it
gives you a way to identify which button in a form was pressed,
letting you process any one of several different forms with a single
form-processing application.

<p class=para>
The following are all valid submission buttons:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=submit&gt;
&lt;input type=submit value="Order Kumquats"&gt;
&lt;input type=submit value="Ship Overnight" name="ship_style"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first one is also the simplest: the browser displays a
button, labeled "Submit," which activates the
form-processing sequence when clicked by the user. It does not add
an element to the parameter list that the browser passes to the
form-processing server and application.

<p class=para>
The second
example button has the value attribute that makes the displayed
button label "Order Kumquats," but like the first
example, does not include the button's value in the form's
parameter list.

<p class=para>
The last example sets the button label
and makes it part of the form's parameter list. When clicked
by the user, that last example of the submission button adds the
parameter ship_style="Ship Overnight" to the form's
parameter list.

<p class=para>
reset buttons

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.2">Reset buttons</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The 
reset type of form <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
button is nearly self-explanatory: it lets the user reset--erase
or set to some default value--all elements in the form.
Unlike the other buttons, a reset button does not initiate form
processing. Instead, the browser does the work of resetting the
form elements. The server never knows (or cares, for that matter)
if or when the user might have pressed a reset button.

<p class=para>
By
default, the browser displays a reset button with the label "Reset."
You can change that by specifying a value attribute with your own
button label.

<p class=para>
Here are two sample reset buttons:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=reset&gt;
&lt;input type=reset value="Use Defaults"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first one creates a reset button labeled "Reset";
the browser labels the second example reset button with "Use
Defaults." They both initiate the same reset response in
the browser.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.3">Custom image buttons</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The image type of <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> form element creates a
custom button that is a "clickable" image. It's a special button made
out of your specified image that, when clicked by the user, tells the
browser to submit the form to the server, and includes the x,y
coordinates of the mouse pointer in the form's parameter list, much
like the mouse-sensitive image maps we discuss in 
<a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, <i>Links and Webs</i></A>. Image buttons require a src attribute with the
URL of the image file, and you can include a name attribute.  You may
also use align and border (Netscape only) attributes to control image
alignment within the current line of text and the width of the frame
that Netscape places around the image, respectively, much like the
align and border attributes for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag
(Internet Explorer doesn't border form <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
images). Interestingly, none of the JavaScript event
handlers work with this type of form element, despite what the
manufacturer's documentation says--not even onClick, which you
might expect, since the image acts like the submit input type.

<p class=para>
Here are a couple of valid image buttons:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=image src="pics/map.gif" name=map&gt;
&lt;input type=image src="pics/xmap.gif" align=top name=map&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The browser displays the designated image within the form's
content flow. The second button's image will be aligned
with the top of the adjacent text, as specified by the align attribute.
Some browsers (Netscape, for instance) also add a border, as it
does when an image is part of an anchor (<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag),
to signal that the image is a form button.

<p class=para>
When the
user clicks the image, the browser sends the horizontal offset,
in pixels, of the mouse from the left edge of the image and the
vertical offset from the top edge of the image to the server. These
values are assigned the name of the image as specified with the
name attribute, followed by ".x" and ".y,"
respectively. Thus, if someone clicked the image specified above,
the browser would send parameters named map.x and map.y to the server.

<p class=para>
Image buttons behave much like mouse-sensitive image
maps, and, like the programs that process image maps, your form-processing
application may use the x,y mouse-pointer parameters to choose a
special course of action. You should use an image button when you
need additional form information to process the user's
request. If an image map of links is all you need, use a mouse-sensitive
image map. Mouse-sensitive images also have the added benefit of
providing server-side support for automatic detection of shape selection
within the image, letting you deal with the image as a selectable
collection of shapes. Buttons with images require you to write code
that determines where the user clicked on the image and how this
position can be translated to an appropriate action by the server.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.4">Regular buttons</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Using the <tt>&lt;input
type=button&gt;</TT> tag, you can create a button that
can be clicked by the user but that does not submit or reset the
form. The value attribute can be used to set the label on the button;
the name attribute, if specified, will cause the supplied value
to be passed to the form processing script.

<p class=para>
You might
wonder what value such buttons provide. Little or none, unless you
supply the 
onClick
attribute, along with a snippet of JavaScript to be executed when
the user clicks the button. Thus empowered, regular buttons can
be used to validate form contents, update fields, manipulate the
document, and initiate all sorts of client-side activity. [<a href="ch13_03.html#HTML-CH-13-SECT-3.3">the section called "JavaScript Event Handlers"</A>]

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.5.5">Multiple buttons in a single form</A></h4>

<p class=para>
You
can have several buttons of the same or different types in a single
form. Even simple forms have both reset and submit buttons, for
example. To distinguish between them, make sure each has a different
value attribute, which the browser uses for the button label. Depending
on the way you program the form-processing application, you might
also make the name of each button different, but it is usually easier
to name all similarly acting buttons the same and let the button
handling subroutine sort them out by value. For instance:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=submit name=action value="Add"&gt;
&lt;input type=submit name=action value="Delete"&gt;
&lt;input type=submit name=action value="Change"&gt;
&lt;input type=submit name=action value="Cancel"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
When the user selects one of these example buttons, a form
parameter named action will be sent to the server. The value of
this parameter will be one of the button names. The server-side
application gets the value and behaves accordingly.

<p class=para>
Since
an image button doesn't have a value attribute, the only
way to distinguish between several image buttons on a single form
is to ensure they all have different names. 

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.6">Hidden Fields</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The last type of form input element we describe
in this chapter is hidden from view. No, we're not trying
to conceal anything. It's a way to embed information into
your forms that cannot be ignored or altered by the browser or user.
Rather, the <tt>&lt;input type=hidden&gt;</TT> tag's
required name and value attributes automatically get included in
the submitted form's parameter list. These serve to label
the form and can be invaluable when sorting out different forms
or form versions from a collection of submitted and saved forms.

<p class=para>
Another use for hidden fields is to manage user/server
interactions. For instance, it helps the server to know that the
current form has come from a person who made a similar request a
few moments ago. Normally, the server does not retain this information
and each transaction between the server and client is completely
independent from all other transactions.

<p class=para>
For example,
the first form submitted by the user might have asked for some basic
information, such as the user's name and where they live.
Based on that initial contact, the server might create a second
form asking more specific questions of the user. Since it is tedious
for users to re-enter the same basic information from the first
form, the server can be programmed to put those values in the second
form in hidden fields. When the second form comes back, all the
important information from both forms is there, and the second form
can be matched to the first one, if necessary.

<p class=para>
Hidden
fields may also direct the server towards some specific action.
For example, you might embed the hidden field:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=hidden name=action value=change&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Therefore,
if you have one server-side application that handles the processing
of several forms, each form might contain a different action code
to help that server application sort things out.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.7">The style and class Attributes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The 
style attribute
for the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag creates an inline style for
the elements enclosed by the tag, overriding any other style rule
in effect. The class attribute lets you format the content according
to a predefined class of the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> tag; its
value is the name of that class. The style-conscious browsers cannot
distinguish between the various input types, so we recommend that
if you use style classes at all, use them with the various form
input types. However, be aware that the style properties usually
don't affect the appearance of the form element itself.

<p class=para>
For instance, you may specify that a text input element should
have a blue background and use the Arial typeface:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=text name=name style="background: blue; font-family: Arial"&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
That doesn't mean it will work. A thin border around
the text input area will be blue, but the text input box itself
will have a white background, and the input text will appear in
the default typeface, not in Arial. [<a href="ch09_01.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-1.1">the section called "Inline Styles: The style Attribute"</A>] [<a href="ch09_02.html#HTML-CH-9-SECT-2.4">the section called "Style Classes"</A>]

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.8">The notab and taborder Attributes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
By
default, every element (except hidden elements) is part of the form's
tab order. As the user presses the tab key, the browser shifts the
input focus from element to element in the form. For most browsers,
the order of the elements in the tab order matches the order of
the elements within the form tag. With Internet
Explorer, you can explicitly control which elements are part of
the form's tab order, and the position of those elements
within the tab order.

<p class=para>
To exclude an element from the
tab order, add the notab attribute to the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
tag. The element will be skipped when the user tabs around the form.

<p class=para>
To reposition an element within the tab order, use the taborder
attribute. The value of the attribute is the element's
desired position in the tab order. If you really want to change
a form's tab order, we suggest you include the taborder
attribute with every element in the form, with an appropriate value
for each element. In this way, you'll be sure to place
every element explicitly in the tab order, and there will be no
surprises when the user tabs through the form.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="HTML-CH-10-SECT-2.9">Form <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> Event Handlers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
JavaScript
browsers support five event handlers for the various <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT>
tag types. The onClick attribute is for when the user clicks a checkbox,
radio, reset, or submit button.[4] Use
the onSelect, onFocus, onBlur, and onChange event handlers for form
text input-related types (text, password, and file) for when the
user selects a form input text area to type in some information,
moves the mouse into the text input box, moves away from the text
input box, and has changed the value of the text, respectively.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
Interestingly, the
image type of input button does not support any of the JavaScript
event handlers; not even onClick, which is supported by the related
submit and reset types, nor any of the event handlers that can be
used with the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
The value of the <tt>&lt;input&gt;</TT> event handler attribute
is--enclosed in quotation marks--one or a sequence
of semicolon-separated JavaScript expressions, methods, and function
references that the browser executes when the event occurs. For
example, you might include an onClick event with the Submit button;
it calls a JavaScript routine that verifies the form is completely
filled out before it is submitted over the network to a processing
server. Other handlers might compute a running total for items checked
on a shopping list, for example. See 13.3.3 for more information
about JavaScript and event handlers.
