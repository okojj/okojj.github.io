<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch11-SECT1-AUTOID.6">11.6 Window and Variable Lifetime</A></h2>

<p class=para>
      We've seen earlier that Window objects are the central feature of
      client-side JavaScript, and that all variables (except those local
      to functions) are actually properties of a window. Having
      investigated the scope of variables, we now turn to the lifetime
      of the Window object, and of the variables it contains. In
      particular, we want to look at what happens when a window or frame
      moves from one web page and on to another.
    

<p class=para>
      A Window object that represents a top-level browser window exists
      as long as the window it represents exists. A reference to that
      Window object remains valid regardless of how many web pages it
      loads and unloads. The Window object is valid as long as the
      top-level window is open.[3]
    

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
	  As we'll see in the next section, a Window object may not
	  actually be destroyed when its window is closed, but
	  references to that window will no longer be of much use.
	
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
      A Window object that represents a frame remains valid as
      long as the frame remains within the frame or window that
      contains it. If the containing frame or window loads a new
      document, then the frames it contains will be destroyed in
      the process of loading that new document.
    

<p class=para>
      This is to say that Window objects, whether they represent
      top-level windows or frames, are fairly persistent--their
      lifetimes may be longer than that of the web pages that they contain
      and display, and longer than the lifetime of the scripts contained
      in the web pages they display.
    

<p class=para>
      When a web page that contains a script is unloaded because the
      user has pointed the browser on to a new page, the script is
      unloaded along with the page that contains it. (If the script was
      not unloaded, a browser might soon be overflowing with various
      lingering scripts!)  But what about the variables defined by the
      script?  Since these variables are actually properties of the
      Window object that contained the script, you might think that they
      would remain defined. On the other hand, leaving them defined
      seems dangerous--a new script that was loaded wouldn't be
      starting with a clean slate, and in fact, it could never know what
      sorts of properties (and therefore variables) were already
      defined.
    

<p class=para>
      In fact, all user-defined properties (which includes all
      variables) are erased whenever a web page is unloaded. The scripts
      in a freshly loaded document start with no variables defined, and
      no properties in their Window object, except for the standard
      properties defined by the system. What this means is that the
      lifetime of scripts and of the variables they define is the same
      as the lifetime of the document that contains the script. This is
      potentially much shorter than the lifetime of the window or frame
      that displays the document that contains the script.
